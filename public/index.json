Text elements Table of contents TOC should be automatically generated unless it is disabled via features: [-toc] in YAML. To define the TOC title, use the toc-title field in YAML. Section numbers Sections should be automatically numbered unless Pandoc has already numbered them,1 or the feature is disabled via features: [-number_sections]. Footnotes Footnotes should be automatically moved to the right margin,2 unless the feature is disabled via features: [-sidenotes]. Sidenotes Sidenotes can be generated via a div with classes side and side-left or side-right. You can use either the HTML syntax or Pandoc’s fenced Div, e.g., This is a sidenote on the right side when the window is wider than 1280px. ::: {.side .side-right} This is a **sidenote** on the right. ::: Citations Use bibliography or references in YAML to include the bibliography database, and use @ to cite items, e.g., @R-base generates R Core Team (2020). knitr::write_bib('base', 'packages.bib') As you can see above, we generated a .bib database with knitr::write_bib().

This theme itself is completely plain-text and lightweight, and does not use any icons, images, or emojis.1 By default, the theme only uses two JavaScript libraries, MathJax and highlight.js, and they are loaded only when necessary. The rest of JavaScript is written from scratch and also relatively short. This theme does not use any CSS frameworks, and the full CSS code is also written from scratch (about 300 lines). It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more. — Letters from a Stoic This page introduces the features of this Hugo theme that you can fiddle with. Site configurations Below are the possible options that you may configure for a site based on this theme. Menus Each page has a menu in the header and a menu in the footer. The header menu is defined in the header option in menu in config.yaml, and similarly, the footer menu is defined in the footer option, e.g., menu: header: - name: Home url: \"/\" weight: 1 - name: About url: \"/about/\" weight: 2 footer: - name: Contact url: \"/404.html\" weight: 1 - name: Categories url: \"/categories/\" weight: 2 pre: \"optional\" The url of a menu item can be either a relative URL pointing to a page on this website, or an external link (e.g., url: \"https://github.com/yihui\"). The order of the menu items is determined by the weight values. If a menu item has a pre value, it will be used as the class of the menu item. The special value optional indicates that this menu item will be hidden on small screens.2 The header menu can be made sticky via the parameter pageFeatures in config.yaml: params: pageFeatuers: [+sticky_menu] This feature can be disabled per-page if enabled globally in config.yaml—-add -sticky_menu to the features YAML field in the single page, e.g., features: [-sticky_menu] Home page The body of the home page consists of an introduction, followed by a series of info cards, and then a number of the latest posts and pages. The introduction comes from content/_index.md. The Markdown content can contain arbitrary elements. The info cards come from the content/card/ directory. Each (Markdown) file is displayed on the home page as a separate card. The title is displayed vertically on the left or right side.3 If you want to customize the style of a certain card, you may use the YAML option style in the file, e.g., --- title: \"Courses\" style: \"background: darkorange; color: white;\" --- This will add a dark orange background to the card, and change the color of text to white. You can use any CSS styles here (e.g., font-size, background-image, and padding). The number of latest posts and pages can be defined via the homePosts option in params in config.yaml, e.g., params: homePosts: 10 The default is 6. The mainSections parameter can be used to select the sections of pages to be included on the home page, e.g., params: mainSections: [\"post\", \"news\"] Footer Besides the menu in the footer, you can specify a copyright statement in the footer parameter in config.yaml, e.g., params: footer: \"\u0026copy; Frida Gomam 2015 -- 2020\" Comments Disqus, Utterances Searching This theme supports searching out of the box based on Fuse.js. A few critical configurations: The site needs to generate a JSON index. This is done via a layout file index.json.json in layouts/_default/, and the config in config.yaml: outputs: home: [html, rss, json] A menu item with the ID menu-search configured in config.yaml, e.g., menu: header: - name: Search url: \"#\" identifier: menu-search The version of Fuse can be configured via the parameter fuseVersion in config.yaml, e.g., params: fuseVersion: 6.4.3 If no fuseVersion is specified, the latest version of Fuse.js will be used. You may also download a copy of Fuse.js to the static/ folder of your site and use this copy instead of loading it from CDN. To do that, you may download Fuse.js to, say, static/js/fuse.js and modify the partial template layouts/partials/foot_custom.html. Replace {{ with .Site.Params.fuseVersion }}  {{ end }} with  That way, you can also use search when viewing the site offline, because Fuse.js is no longer loaded from CDN. Articles At the moment, I’m too tired to complete the documentation. If you want to be an early adopter of this theme, you might have to read the source. Multiple authors If an article has multiple authors, specify their names in an array in the author field. Author’s bio is loaded from the database data/authors.yaml. Table of contents TOC can be automatically generated, no matter if you use Hugo/goldmark or Pandoc/R Markdown. Number sections Section headers can be automatically numbered, no matter if you use Hugo/goldmark or Pandoc/R Markdown. Footnotes, citations, and sidenotes Footnotes and citation entries4 are moved to the right margin by default. If you want to write arbitrary sidenotes, use the classes side and side-left/side-right. This is a sidenote on the left side. You can include anything in the note. For example, here is a bullet list: Get up Do the work Go to bed Content to be displayed as a sidenote.  Appendix Author’s bio Custom fields License Suggest changes Drafts Mark an article as draft by adding draft: true to the YAML metadata. Draft articles are styled with a background of diagonal lines and a watermark “Draft.” For listing pages, draft articles are also indicated by the background. Floats Full-width elements Apply the class fullwidth, e.g., Content to be displayed with its maximum width.  Figure 3.1: Beginning around 301 BC, Zeno taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile (“Painted Porch”), from which his philosophy got its name. Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the Epicureans, Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a colonnade overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the Agora. If you want the full-width element to be scrollable, you can apply an additional class fullscroll, e.g., Super wide content to be scrolled horizontally.  Figure 3.2: This painting is known as the “Qing Court Version” of Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Here, the figural scenes are numerous and detailed, happening around noteworthy landmarks and places such as the serene rustic countryside, the Rainbow Bridge (虹橋) and its crowded markets, the lively surroundings and throughways at the city walls and gates, the busy streets and various packed shops, the secluded literati gardens, the Songzhu Hall (松竹軒) as well as the beautiful site of the Jinming Lake (金明池). Embedded elements Use the embed-left or embed-right class to embed a content block to be floated to the left or right, and the block will exceed the article margin by 200px, e.g., Content to be embedded onto the margin.  One application is to embed videos in an article, when the video needs a narrative. For example, you can embed a video on the right side, and provide a narrative in the body of the article, which will be on the left side of the video. By default, the max-width of the embedded element is 600px (the actual width could be smaller), out of which 200px will be in the margin, meaning that there will be at least 400px left for the narrative in the article body. When the screen width is smaller than 1200px, the embedded elements will be floated back into the article as normal block-level elements. Quotes Use the quote-left or quote-right class to make content float to the left or right. A quote to be floated to the left.  The quotes do not have to be literally quotes. These environments can contain any content, although quotes may be the most common application. Here is a quote that I’ve never said. The default width of the content is 45% of the container. You have seen an example of quote-right at the beginning of this article. Here is an example of quote-left on the left side. The quotes will stop floating and become normal block-level elements when the screen width is smaller than 800px.

His writing is highly accessible and was the subject of attention from the Renaissance onwards by writers such as Michel de Montaigne. He has been described as “a towering and controversial figure of antiquity” and “the world’s most interesting Stoic”.\nSeneca wrote a number of books on Stoicism, mostly on ethics, with one work (Naturales Quaestiones) on the physical world. Seneca built on the writings of many of the earlier Stoics: he often mentions Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus; and frequently cites Posidonius, with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena. He frequently quotes Epicurus, especially in his Letters.\n","title":"Philosophy","uri":"/philosophy/"},{"content":"Ten plays are attributed to Seneca, of which most likely eight were written by him. The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works. With their intense emotions, and grim overall tone, the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca’s Stoic beliefs. Up to the 16th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people. Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes: it is the uncontrolled passions that generate madness, ruination, and self-destruction. This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.\n","title":"Projects","uri":"/projects/"},{"content":"Below is a full list of posts and pages on this website ordered by date.\n","title":"Sitemap","uri":"/sitemap/"}]
