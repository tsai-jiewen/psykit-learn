"NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCES OF A PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION FROM CAMPUS LEARNING TO DISTANCE LEARNING USING DIGITAL TOOLS BLENDED LEARNING;  DISTANCE LEARNING; DIGITAL TOOLS; QUANTITATIVE METHOD; QUALITATIVE METHOD; SOCIAL INTERACTION [MESH];  EDUCATION; PROFESSIONAL [MESH];  TEACHING [MESH] NA BACKGROUND: THE USE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION USING DIGITAL TOOLS IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAS INCREASED OVER THE LAST DECADE, PARTICULARLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE AND EVALUATE NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCES OF THE PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION FROM TRADITIONAL CAMPUS BASED LEARNING TO DISTANCE LEARNING USING DIGITAL TOOLS. METHODS: THE NURSING COURSE SYMPTOM AND SIGNS OF ILLNESS UNDERWENT A TRANSITION FROM CAMPUS BASED EDUCATION TO DISTANCE LEARNING USING DIGITAL TOOLS BECAUSE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION IN TEACHING WAS EVALUATED USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS. FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS (N = 9) WERE ANALYSED USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE STUDENTS EXPERIENCES OF THE PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION AND TO CONSTRUCT A WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE COMPRISED 14 ITEMS, INCLUDING TWO OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DELIVERED TO ALL COURSE PARTICIPANTS AND RESPONSES WERE OBTAINED FROM 96 OF 132 STUDENTS (73%). QUESTIONNAIRE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND COMMENTS FROM THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS WERE USED AS QUOTES TO HIGHLIGHT THE QUANTITATIVE DATA. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS OF THE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS EXTRACTED THREE MAIN DIMENSIONS: DIDACTIC ASPECTS OF DIGITAL TEACHING, STUDY ENVIRONMENT, AND STUDENTS OWN RESOURCES. SOCIAL INTERACTION WAS AN OVERALL THEME INCLUDED IN ALL THREE DIMENSIONS. DATA FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE SHOWED THAT A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS PREFERRED CAMPUS BASED EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION IN ALL INVESTIGATED DIMENSIONS AFTER THE PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE STUDENTS APPEARED TO PREFER DISTANCE LEARNING USING DIGITAL TOOLS. CONCLUSIONS: THE MAIN FINDING WAS THAT THE PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION TO DISTANCE EDUCATION REDUCED THE POSSIBILITY FOR STUDENTS SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN THEIR LEARNING PROCESS. THIS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE OF DISTANCE LEARNING USING DIGITAL TOOLS, SUCH AS REDUCED MOTIVATION. HOWEVER, THE HETEROGENEITY IN THE RESPONSES SUGGESTED THAT A BLENDED LEARNING APPROACH MAY OFFER PEDAGOGICAL BENEFITS WHILE MAINTAINING AN ADVANTAGEOUS LEVEL OF SOCIAL INTERACTION. 2021, THE AUTHOR(S).",2021,NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCES OF A PEDAGOGICAL TRANSITION FROM CAMPUS LEARNING TO DISTANCE LEARNING USING DIGITAL TOOLS,1

CONTROLLING FOR GENDER AND GENERAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS LEARNING MATHEMATICS WITH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT), STUDENTS IN THE MORE PROMISING CLUSTER REPORTED HIGHER EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS, HIGHER NEED FOR FACE-TO-FACE SOCIAL INTERACTION, AND LESS PREFERENCE FOR ONLINE LEARNING FORMATS AFTER THE PANDEMIC SITUATION THAN STUDENTS FROM THE LESS PROMISING CLUSTER. HOWEVER, STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT CLUSTERS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THEIR SUBJECTIVE TASK VALUE, THEIR LEARNING OUTSIDE OF COURSE STRUCTURES, AND THEIR APPRECIATION OF DIGITAL LEARNING FORMATS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A POSITIVE GENERAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS LEARNING WITH ICT WAS THE KEY ELEMENT INFLUENCING STUDENTS COPING WITH LEARNING IN THE PANDEMIC SITUATION.

THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO ANALYZE THE FACULTY MEMBERS EXPERIENCES ABOUT THE CHANGE FROM FACE-TO-FACE TO AN ONLINE MODALITY IN THE HEALTH EMERGENCY CONTEXT DUE TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK. WE DESIGNED A STUDY TO GATHER INFORMATION ON PRACTICE IN THE NEW ONLINE LEARNING SCENARIO. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE COLLECTED DATA ON THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN THE CONDUCT OF ONLINE COURSES, THE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS USED, THE BARRIERS FACED WHILE DRIVING ONLINE COURSES, THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF USE OF EDUCATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS, THE VISION FOR THE FUTURE, AND SOME INDICATORS OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH.IN A SAMPLE OF 341 FACULTY MEMBERS, THOSE WORKING IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WERE ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN THEIR PEERS ATTACHED TO PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. IN CONTRAST, LECTURERS RECORDED BETTER CONDITIONS FOR DEALING WITH MODALITY CHANGE THAN FULL-TIME TEACHERS. LIKEWISE, LECTURERS MORE OFTEN MENTIONED HAVING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO TEACH COURSES FROM THEIR HOMES THAN FULL-TIME TEACHERS, WHICH INDEED RESPONDS TO LESS ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITIES FACILITIES IN WHICH THEY TEACH. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE INCREASED PROPORTION OF TEACHERS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND LECTURERS WHO HAVE OTHER JOBS, SO THEIR WORKLOAD CAN BE MORE INTENSE THAN THOSE OF THEIR PEERS.

AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF LEARNERS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AT A UNIVERSITY IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY NA NA COVID-19 HAS DRAMATICALLY RESHAPED THE WAY GLOBAL EDUCATION IS DELIVERED. MILLIONS OF LEARNERS WERE AFFECTED BY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION CLOSURES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, WHICH RESULTED IN THE LARGEST ONLINE MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. WITH THIS SUDDEN SHIFT AWAY FROM CLASSROOMS IN MANY PARTS OF THE GLOBE, UNIVERSITIES HAD TO RAPIDLY SHIFT TO VIRTUAL AND DIGITAL STRATEGIES. MANY BELIEVE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING WILL PERSIST AFTER PANDEMIC. A NEW HYBRID MODEL OF EDUCATION IS EXPECTED TO EMERGE, AND, GIVEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, NEW SHIFTS IN EDUCATION APPROACHES COULD WIDEN EQUALITY GAPS. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST EMPIRICAL STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF THE SUDDEN SHIFT FROM FACE-TO-FACE TO ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING DUE TO COVID-19 LOCKDOWN AT ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES IN EGYPT. COMPARISON OF GRADES WAS MADE BETWEEN 376 BUSINESS STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED A FACE-TO-FACE COURSE IN SPRING 2019 AND 372 STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED THE SAME COURSE BUT FULLY ONLINE VIA DISTANCE LEARNING MODE IN SPRING 2020 DURING THE LOCKDOWN. T-TEST WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE GRADES OF QUIZZES, COURSE WORK, AND FINAL EXAM FOR THE TWO GROUPS. CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE GRADE DISTRIBUTION FOR BOTH GROUPS. THE EFFECT OF GENDER, CREDIT HOURS, AGE, AND CGPA WAS ASSESSED. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN STUDENTS' GRADES. IN ADDITION, THE UNPLANNED AND RAPID MOVE TO ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING AT THE TIME OF PANDEMIC DID NOT RESULT IN A POOR LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS WAS EXPECTED.

THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION ON THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IN UNIVERSITIES AND TO DESCRIBE THE RISKS THROUGH THE STUDENTS' EYES. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE AUTHORS IN 2020 AMONG STUDENTS OF TWO UNIVERSITIES - MOSCOW STATE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (MGIMO) AND THE INSTITUTE OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT OF THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF LABOR OF VIETNAM (IPLV). THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE METHODOLOGY OF THE ONLINE SURVEY. THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS DISTANCE LEARNING IS INTERPRETED AS A THREE-LEVEL ATTITUDE WITH EMOTIONAL, COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL ASPECTS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT STUDENTS' READINESS TO SWITCH TO DISTANCE LEARNING IS DETERMINED BY A SET OF MACRO AND MICRO FACTORS. AMONG THE MACRO FACTORS ARE THE NATIONAL SPECIFICS OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, TRADITIONS IN THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL POLICY, AND THE MOBILIZATION POTENTIAL OF THE POPULATION. AMONG THE MICRO FACTORS ARE THE COGNITIVE AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDENTS, THE SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL OPENNESS TO INNOVATION. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY RESULTS, THERE IS CERTAIN SIMILARITY IN THE WAY RUSSIAN AND VIETNAMESE STUDENTS ASSESS THEIR EXPERIENCE OF DISTANCE LEARNING. AT THE SAME TIME, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PERCEPTION OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN REVEALED. FOR MGIMO STUDENTS, MAJOR RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEHUMANIZATION, THE SEVERING OF SOCIAL TIES, AND THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF STUDENT STATUS. FOR VIETNAMESE STUDENTS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS ARE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEARS OF THE DECREASING QUALITY OF EDUCATION.

FOR EXAMPLE, THEY CAN USE THESE TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA SUCH AS THE WHATSAPP, TELEGRAM, ZOOM, MICROSOFT TEAM, AND EDMODO APPS TO CONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND LECTURERS. THIS RESEARCH REVEALS TRENDS OF DIGITAL SOCIAL MEDIA SECURITY AND USABILITY IN THE TIME OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SITUATION, SUCH AS WORKING FROM HOME, ESTABLISHING A START-UP, IMPROVING BUSINESS PROCESSES AND CONDUCTING ONLINE BUSINESS WITHIN THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM. THE RESULT IS INTERESTING AND THERE ARE MANY USES OF SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THIS STUDY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THE VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE DIFFERENT FEATURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY SUBSCRIBERS, AND ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO DO BUSINESS. THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY OPEN UP THE GLOBAL MARKET AND ALSO MAKE IT CHEAPER TO ADVERTISE. THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. MAINTAINING A GOOD ONLINE PRESENCE IS ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS THAT DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF START-UP COMPANIES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT MOST CUSTOMERS USUALLY RELY ON THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS IN DETERMINING THE ABILITY OF A COMPANY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CLIENTS. THE MAIN REASON WHY MOST COMPANIES SET UP A CUSTOMER RELATIONS DEPARTMENT THAT IS MANDATED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RESPONDING TO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK ON VARIOUS ONLINE PLATFORMS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE INCREASED USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BROUGHT NEW CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE SECURITY OF INFORMATION. USERS MUST, THEREFORE, SECURE THEIR SERVERS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THREATS. ONE OF THE STRATEGIES USED IS THE USE OF PASSWORDS TO LOG INTO A PORTAL WHERE EACH PERSON AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE PORTAL IS PROVIDED WITH A PASSWORD THAT IS UNIQUE AND KNOWN ONLY BY THE USER.

IN THE RELIANCE ON VIDEOCONFERENCING TOOLS, CHAT, THE SHARING OF DOCUMENTS/ TUTORIALS/VIDEOS/PODCASTS, AND THE USE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS, MANY IDEAS HAVE EMERGED, BUT NO CONSENSUS HAS DEVELOPED NOR HAS A COMMON WAY OF DOING THINGS BEEN ADOPTED BY A MAJORITY OF TEACHERS. SOME SOFTWARE TOOLS, SUCH AS ZOOM, HAVE ALSO BEEN QUESTIONED OVER DATA SECURITY ISSUES OR EXCESSIVE INTRUSION INTO THE STUDENT LEARNING PROCESS. NEVERTHELESS, IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES, MUCH HAD TO BE DONE SO THAT STUDENTS CAN ACQUIRE THE REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE, DEVELOP SKILLS, AND BUILD ON WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THE LEARNING PROCESS IS AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED? HOW CAN WE EVALUATE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS LEARNED AT A DISTANCE, AND THEIR RELEVANCE?

THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE ASPECTS OF CHANGES IN THE MODERN MODEL OF HIGHER EDUCATION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DESIRE TO POSITION UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD EDUCATIONAL RANKINGS. THE BASIS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE CHOICE OF DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES HAS BEEN FORMED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GROWING DISSATISFACTION OF TEACHERS WITH THE NEED TO MATCH THE MODEL OF SUCCESS AND EXCELLENCE IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES. IT WAS FOUND THAT PRE-PANDEMIC TRENDS IN EDUCATION WERE MULTIDIRECTIONAL, AND THEIR IMPACT ON EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND LEARNING MODELS (GLOBAL OR REGIONAL) WAS MORE STIMULATING FOR DEVELOPMENT, RATHER THAN MANDATORY FOR SURVIVAL. THE CRISIS HAS DIVIDED THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE NEW INTO TWO COMPONENTS: NECESSARY RENEWAL AND SUFFICIENT IMPROVEMENT TO ENSURE STABILITY. IT IS NOTED THAT EDUCATION IS CHARACTERIZED BY A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS, SO THE EXTREME TRANSITION TO DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC ACTUALLY REPLACED THE EVOLUTIONARY PERIOD OF TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATION, WHICH WOULD HAVE LASTED FOR MORE THAN ONE DECADE. ACADEMIC MOBILITY, WHICH HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD IN THE WORLD, BUT WHICH WAS FORCED TO TEMPORARILY STOP ITS ACTIVITY DURING THE PANDEMIC, IN THE NEW CONDITIONS CAN CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE RANKING OF UNIVERSITIES, BUT CAN ALSO CARRY THREATS OF PRECARIZATION TO THEIR WORKING TEACHERS AND BECOME A SOURCE OF SOCIAL TENSION, WHICH SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DEVELOPING UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSAL DIGITALIZATION.

THE STUDY WAS PREMISED ON THE FACT THAT LEARNING IN SOUTH AFRICA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD CAME TO A STANDSTILL DUE TO THE LOCKDOWN NECESSITATED BY COVID-19. TO ASSESS THE IMPACT, THE STUDY TRACKED THE RATE AT WHICH THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (4IR) TOOLS WERE USED BY VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS DURING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN. DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM SECONDARY SOURCES. THE FINDINGS ARE THAT, IN SOUTH AFRICA, DURING THE LOCKDOWN, A VARIETY OF 4IR TOOLS WERE UNLEASHED FROM PRIMARY EDUCATION TO HIGHER AND TERTIARY EDUCATION WHERE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES SWITCHED TO REMOTE (ONLINE) LEARNING. THESE OBSERVATIONS REFLECT THAT SOUTH AFRICA GENERALLY HAS SOME POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE TO DRIVE THE EDUCATION SECTOR INTO THE 4IR, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE ACCESS.

HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH ON DIGITAL LEARNING DESIGNS WITHIN PHYSIOTHERAPY EDUCATION IS LIMITED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIGITAL LEARNING DESIGNS IN PHYSIOTHERAPY EDUCATION. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED AS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED AND NON-RANDOMIZED TRIALS. A SEARCH OF EIGHT DATABASES ON DIGITAL LEARNING DESIGNS AND TECHNOLOGY WAS CONDUCTED. STUDY SELECTION, METHODOLOGY AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY THREE REVIEWERS. THE INCLUDED STUDIES WERE MAPPED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF DIGITAL INTERVENTIONS AND STUDIES. FOR SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS, THE LEARNING EFFECTS WERE CALCULATED USING META-ANALYSES. RESULTS: ALTOGETHER, 22 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW (17 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND FIVE COHORT STUDIES). A BLENDED LEARNING DESIGN WAS USED IN 21 STUDIES, A FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL IN FIVE AND A DISTANCE LEARNING DESIGN IN ONE. ALTOGETHER, 10 OF THE 22 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN META-ANALYSES, WHICH SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR FLIPPED CLASSROOMS ON KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION (STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE [SMD]: 0.41; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 0.20, 0.62), FOR INTERACTIVE WEBSITES OR APPLICATIONS (APPS) ON PRACTICAL SKILLS (SMD: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.71,1.43) AND FOR STUDENTS SELF-PRODUCED VIDEOS ON A PRACTICAL SKILL IN A CERVICAL SPINE SCENARIO (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.93). OVERALL, THE EFFECTS INDICATED THAT BLENDED LEARNING DESIGNS ARE EQUALLY AS OR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM TEACHING TO ACHIEVE LEARNING OUTCOMES. DISTANCE LEARNING SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM TEACHING. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT FINDINGS FROM PHYSIOTHERAPY EDUCATION INDICATE THAT DIGITAL LEARNING DESIGNS IN THE FORM OF BLENDED LEARNING AND DISTANCE LEARNING WERE EQUALLY OR MORE EFFECTIVE COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL TEACHING.

IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS, HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTES (HEIS), INCLUDING UNIVERSITIES, HAVE INSTITUTIONALIZED INTERMEDIARY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICES (TTOS). IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT RESEARCH ON THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAS EXTENDED ITS FOCUS FROM ANALYZING THEIR FUNCTIONS AND PERFORMANCE TO THE INTERNAL PROCESSES AND PRACTICES OF THEIR WORK. BASED ON QUALITATIVE DATA DERIVED FROM A PROCESS-RELATED FOCUSED ETHNOGRAPHY, THIS PAPER PRESENTS INSIGHTS INTO THE PRACTICES OF A GROUP OF TRANSFER SCOUTS. THEIR DISTINCTIVE FEATURE IS THAT THEY ARE DEPLOYED EXPLICITLY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING EXPERTISE TO INTENSIFY THE UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY LINKAGES IN AN EAST GERMAN REGION. APART FROM MERE MEDIATION, THESE TRANSFER SCOUTS BECOME CO-CREATORS OF NEW KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGIES IN TRANSFER PROCESSES. THEIR ORIENTATION TOWARDS SCIENCE, THEIR THEMATIC SPECIALIZATION, THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL TRANSFER INSTRUMENTS, THEIR EXPLICIT INTENTION TO CONTRIBUTE TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS THEIR CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL ACTING KEEPS THEM INVOLVED IN CO-CREATIONAL AND MULTIDIRECTIONAL KNOWLEDGE-PRODUCTION AND MAKES THEM ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE PROCESSES. FOR TRANSFER INTERMEDIARIES, THESE INSIGHTS OFFER AN EXTENSION OF THEIR IDENTITY AS BROKERING ACTORS BETWEEN THE ACADEMIC AND THE BUSINESS SECTORS. SINCE DIVERSE ACTORS OPERATE IN THE REGIONAL TRANSFER SYSTEM AND CONFRONT TRANSFER SCOUTS WITH TENSIONS BETWEEN COOPERATION AND COMPETITION, NEGOTIATION PROCESSES CAN BE FIERCELY CONTESTED, MET BY RESISTANCE, AND ACCOMPANIED BY CONFLICTS. WITH REGARD TO COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES, AS WELL AS IN THE CASE OF CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS, A DURABLE COOPERATION BETWEEN TTOS AND TRANSFER SCOUTS PROMISES TO GENERATE POTENTIALLY INNOVATIVE IMPULSES. BUT THIS IS LESS A STABLE SETTING THAN AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT REQUIRES MANY ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCIES AND SUPPORTING STRUCTURES TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ORGANIZATIONS. THE QUESTION ARISES, WHETHER SUCH COMPLEX KTT STRUCTURES CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INSTITUTIONALIZED OUTSIDE THE FRAME OF A FIXED TERM PROJECT.

SEVERAL FACETS OF THIS PROCESS AND CORRESPONDING CHALLENGES EXIST, INCLUDING THE COMPLEX QUESTION OF HOW TO MATCH STUDENTS SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES WITH THE DEMANDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE INDUSTRY. FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE, CONSIDERING THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK, HEIS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EQUIPPING FUTURE EMPLOYEES WITH SKILLS NECESSARY TO WORK IN VIRTUAL, DISTRIBUTED, CULTURALLY DIVERSE, AND FREQUENTLY GLOBAL, TEAMS. IN THE DOMAIN OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, I.E., THE BACKBONE OF THE DIGITAL WORLD, THE CHALLENGE HEIS NEED TO FACE IS PARAMOUNT. FOR THIS REASON, THE WAY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS TAUGHT AT HEIS IS CRUCIAL FOR THE INDUSTRY, FOR THE ECONOMY, FOR THE STUDENTS, AND FOR THE HEIS. AS THERE IS A TENDENCY IN THE INDUSTRY TO EMBRACE THE SCRUM METHOD AND SEEK EMPLOYEES EQUIPPED WITH SKILLS NECESSARY FOR THE SCRUM METHODOLOGY USE, IT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT HEIS OFFER THE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET EXPOSED TO SCRUM. BY QUERYING THE CHALLENGES OF SWITCHING TO AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES IN SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECTS, THIS PAPER MAKES A CASE THAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY FORM THE THRUST OF A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER ECOSYSTEM THAT DEFINES TODAYS DIGITAL ECONOMY AND SOCIETY.

WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM THE END OF ACTIVE PIVOT PROGRAM PARTICIPATION IN 319 ADULT SMOKERS. HEREIN, WE REPORT LONGER-TERM FOLLOW UP IN THIS COHORT. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS AND REPORT PARTICIPANT OUTCOMES 3 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION OF PIVOT, INCLUDING SMOKING BEHAVIOR, QUIT RATES, CONTINUOUS ABSTINENCE RATES AND DURABILITY, AND PREDICTORS OF ABSTINENCE. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE REMOTE COHORT STUDY INCLUDED US-BASED CIGARETTE SMOKERS AGED 18 TO 65 YEARS WHO SMOKED 5 CIGARETTES PER DAY (CPD). THREE MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION OF ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN PIVOT, FINAL FOLLOW-UP DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE. OUTCOMES INCLUDED SMOKING BEHAVIOR (CPD AND QUIT ATTEMPTS), SELF-REPORTED QUIT RATES (7- AND 30-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE [PPA]), AND CONTINUOUS ABSTINENCE RATES (PROPORTION WHO ACHIEVED UNINTERRUPTED ABSTINENCE) AND DURATION. EXPLORATORY REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVEMENT OF 7-DAY PPA, 30-DAY PPA, AND CONTINUOUS ABSTINENCE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 319 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ONBOARDING (INTENTION-TO-TREAT [ITT]); 288/319 PARTICIPANTS (90.3%) COMPLETED FOLLOW UP (COMPLETERS) AT A MEAN OF 7.2 (SD 1.2) MONTHS AFTER ONBOARDING. AT FINAL FOLLOW UP, CPD WERE REDUCED BY 52.6% (SE 2.1; P<.001) AMONG ALL 319 PARTICIPANTS, AND MOST COMPLETERS (152/288, 52.8%) REDUCED THEIR CPD BY AT LEAST 50%. OVERALL, MOST COMPLETERS (232/288, 80.6%) MADE AT LEAST ONE QUIT ATTEMPT. QUIT RATES INCREASED AFTER THE END OF PIVOT; USING ITT ANALYSES, 35.4% (113/319) ACHIEVED 7-DAY PPA AND 31.3% (100/319) ACHIEVED 30-DAY PPA AT FINAL FOLLOW UP COMPARED WITH 32.0% (102/319) AND 27.6% (88/319), RESPECTIVELY, AT THE END OF THE PIVOT PROGRAM. CONTINUOUS ABSTINENCE WAS ACHIEVED IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF THOSE WHO ONBOARDED (76/319, 23.8%) AND IN MOST WHO REPORTED 30-DAY PPA AT THE END OF PIVOT (76/88, 86.4%), WITH A MEAN ABSTINENCE DURATION OF 5.8 (SD 0.6) MONTHS. IN EXPLORATORY REGRESSION ANALYSES, LOWER BASELINE CPD, MORE POSITIVE BASELINE ATTITUDES REFLECTING HIGHER SELF-EFFICACY (HIGHER CONFIDENCE TO QUIT AND LOWER PERCEIVED DIFFICULTY OF QUITTING), AND HIGHER EDUCATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING ABSTINENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST LONGER-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PIVOT SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM. AT FINAL FOLLOW UP, QUIT RATES INCREASED AND CONTINUOUS ABSTINENCE WAS FAVORABLE; THE MAJORITY WHO ACHIEVED ABSTINENCE AT THE END OF PIVOT SUSTAINED ABSTINENCE THROUGHOUT FOLLOW UP. DECREASES IN CPD PERSISTED AND MOST PARTICIPANTS MADE A QUIT ATTEMPT. OVERALL, FINAL FOLLOW-UP OUTCOMES WERE STABLE OR IMPROVED WHEN COMPARED TO PREVIOUS OUTCOMES FROM THE END OF THE PROGRAM.

THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THIS DISCOURSE BY DRAWING ON FINDINGS FROM A LARGE-SCALE STUDY (N = 810) CONDUCTED ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN ENGLAND THAT CRITICALLY EXAMINED STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF AND ATTITUDES TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF ONLINE HARASSMENT, INCLUDING ABUSIVE, OFFENSIVE AND HARASSING COMMUNICATIONS, USING SURVEY AND INTERVIEW DATA. KEY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ONLINE HARASSMENT IS SO PERVASIVE IN DIGITISED SPACES THAT IT IS OFTEN VIEWED AS THE NORM BY THE STUDENT POPULATION WHO APPEAR WILLING TO TOLERATE IT, RATHER THAN TAKE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS IT, WHICH CHALLENGES PEJORATIVE CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE INTOLERANT AND EASILY OFFENDED SNOWFLAKES. RESPONDENTS WHO IDENTIFY AS FEMALE AND TRANSGENDER ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TARGETED BY ONLINE HARASSMENT. WE ARGUE THAT THE LABEL SNOWFLAKE GENERATION IS DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM STUDENTS EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES OF ONLINE HARASSMENT AND ITS ADVERSE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY ON WOMEN AND TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A GENDER-RELATED DIGITAL DIVIDE (JANE, 2018).

"THE CONSTITUTION OF MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE WITH AUGMENTED REALITY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES;  MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION;  PHENOMENOLOGY;  TEACHING OF CALCULUS NA DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE INCREASINGLY PRESENT IN OUR ACTIVITIES. MANY THINGS WE DO WE ARE NOT EVEN ABLE TO IMAGINE HOW THEY WOULD BE DONE, IF WE DID NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AT HAND. HOWEVER, PERHAPS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THIS, IN THE SCHOOL CONTEXT, OR IN TEACHING AND LEARNING, THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL AND THE VIABILITY OF THESE RESOURCES IS STILL SUBJECT OF A NON-CONSENSUAL DISCUSSION. WHEN THIS CONTEXT IS HIGHER EDUCATION, SPECIFICALLY IN UNDERGRADUATE COURSES, THE SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE, AS STATED BY RESEARCH THAT WE BRING IN THIS TEXT. IN DISCIPLINES SUCH AS DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES (DT) CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A TREATMENT IN WHICH ASPECTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND VISUALIZATION ARE EXPLORED.

THE POST-INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS A NETWORK SOCIETY. SPECIFICALLY, THE REVOLUTION IN MEDIA TODAY DEFINES THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN THE EDUCATIONAL SECTOR. ITS MODERNIZATION IN THE 1990S IN RUSSIA BEGAN THROUGH THE DISCUSSION OF THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF THE CLASSICAL UNIVERSITY MODEL. HOWEVER, THE PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION AND THE MOBILITY OF EDUCATION DEMANDED THE ALIGNMENT AND UNIFICATION OF NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THE BOLOGNA PROCESS WAS A RESPONSE. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN RUSSIA AS A TWO-TIERED SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH THE SOCIETY STILL NEEDED SPECIALISTS AND ENGINEERS RATHER THAN BACHELORS AND MASTERS. THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS TO COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THEN LED TO THE NECESSITY OF ECONOMIC REFORM. SOCIETY NEEDED EDUCATED SPECIALISTS BUT COULD NOT SUPPORT A LARGE NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WITH A SIZABLE STAFF. IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR, AUTOMATIZATION LEADS TO A GROWTH IN WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY WHEREAS IN EDUCATION THE TRADITIONAL PEDAGOGY IS MAINLY PRACTICED. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE OPENED UP NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INCREASED ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF CENTERS OF EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THE FACULTY BODY, ESPECIALLY IN THE HUMANITIES SPHERE, EXPRESSED STRONG CRITICISM. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT SOLVE PEDAGOGIC PROBLEMS. WHILE DISCUSSING THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, THE MAIN, SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE OF THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN LEFT ASIDE.

MLEARNING MIGHT ALSO BE WELL SUITED FOR NURSING STUDENTS AS THEY NAVIGATE BETWEEN MULTIPLE LEARNING CONTEXTS IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM. AS AN EDUCATIONAL STRATEGY, MLEARNING MAY ALSO REDUCE CHALLENGES CAUSED BY THE THEORY-PRACTICE GAP IN NURSING BY SUPPORTING SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND CLINICAL SETTINGS. AS THE INTRODUCTION OF BASIC PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT SKILLS (B-PASS) INTO NORWEGIAN BACHELOR'S DEGREE EDUCATION IN NURSING OCCURRED QUITE RECENTLY, THERE IS A LACK OF COMPETENCE IN SUPERVISION AND TEACHING IN BOTH UNIVERSITY AND CLINICAL SETTINGS. AS SUCH, MLEARNING APPEARS TO BE A GOOD STRATEGY TO SUPPORT STUDENT B-PAS LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER ACROSS LEARNING CONTEXTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE AND ELICIT THE PERSPECTIVES OF STUDENTS REGARDING THE WAY IN WHICH A SELECTION OF DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES SUPPORTS B-PAS LEARNING AND APPLICATION IN CLINICAL ROTATION, WHICH OF THE SELECTED DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES ARE BENEFICIAL TO INCLUDE IN A SUITE OF MLEARNING TOOLS, AND HOW THE SELECTED DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES COULD SUPPORT THE TRANSFER OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE FROM THE ACADEMIC TO CLINICAL CONTEXT. METHODS: WE USED A LONGITUDINAL PARTICIPATORY DESIGN APPROACH TO CO-DESIGN A SUITE OF MLEARNING TOOLS. THE CO-DESIGN PROCESSES TOOK PLACE IN SEVERAL WORKSHOPS (WSS) OVER A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS: 2 WSS WITH FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS (N=6), 3 WSS WITH SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS (N=6), AND 3 WSS WITH THIRD-YEAR STUDENTS (N=8). THE STUDENTS EVALUATED SEVERAL DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES IN BOTH ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL CONTEXTS. THE DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES INCLUDED DIGITAL SIMULATION WITH VIRTUAL PATIENTS, MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES, AND MULTIMEDIA LEARNING MATERIAL. IN THE CO-DESIGN WS, THE POTENTIAL AND BENEFITS OF THESE DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES FOR THE LEARNING AND APPLICATION OF B-PASS WERE EXPLORED. RESULTS: THE STUDENTS REPORTED THAT THE DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES STIMULATED LEARNING IN 7 DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING ALL SELECTED AND TESTED DIGITAL LEARNING RESOURCES. MOREOVER, STUDENTS SUPPORTED THE INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL LEARNING MATERIAL, SUCH AS MULTIPLE-CHOICE TESTS AND WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS, AIMED AT PROVIDING FEEDBACK AND CONTRIBUTING TO KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT.

USING THE FRAMEWORK OF STAKEHOLDERS THEORY, THIS WORK AIMS TO EXAMINE STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF ETHICAL AND CSR PRACTICES AND COMMITMENT TO DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS, AS WELL AS THE FACTORS THAT LEAD STUDENTS TO ACT IN A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY. FURTHERMORE, WE HOPE TO IDENTIFY HOW THE PERCEPTION OF CSR CAN BE IMPROVED WHEN WEB 2.0 AND SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS THAT HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN TRANSMITTING EMOTIONS AND VALUES ARE USED IN CLASSROOMS TO TEACH THESE IDEAS. TO THIS END, A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE YEAR 2019 WITH 1,030 FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS; IT WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER AND ALSO AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER AFTER THE TRAINING ACTIVITIES HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE MAIN FINDING OF THE RESEARCH IS THAT STUDENTS START WITH THE BELIEF THAT ETHICS AND CSR ARE DEVELOPED FOR REASONS OF IMAGE AND LEGITIMACY; HOWEVER, AFTER RECEIVING TRAINING ON THESE TOPICS THROUGH TOOLS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EMOTIONS AND VALUES, THEY START TO VALUE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPANY AS AN AGENT OF SOCIAL CHANGE. THE MAIN PRACTICAL AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATION IS THAT METHODS BASED ON WEB 2.0 AND SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS ARE USEFUL TO TEACH ETHICS AND CSR; THE THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION IS THAT STUDENTS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WELFARE OF OTHERS. THIS FINDING CONTRIBUTES TO STAKEHOLDER THEORY IN A HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION;  DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY;  DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION;  ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION;  SOCIAL NETWORKS NA ALTHOUGH ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED USING COGNITIVE MODELS, WE STILL LACK ENTREPRENEURIAL VOCATION AND, THEREFORE, LACK DISRUPTIVE INNOVATIONS. ENTREPRENEURSHIP SCHOLARS HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONS UNDERLYING THIS WEAKNESS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN OUR LEARNING CONCERNING HOW TO PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSFORMED CONTEXT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE EARLY STAGES OF START-UP, AND IN PARTICULAR SEEKS TO EVALUATE WHAT ROLE SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS PLAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS. DRAWING ON NETWORK THEORY, WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL NETWORKS ON ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. SPECIFICALLY, WE ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF TWO TYPES OF SOCIAL NETWORKS: FACE-TO-FACE AND ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS, WITH THE LATTER PROVING ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONS. IN ADDITION, BASED ON AFFECTIVE CONGRUENCY THEORY, WE RELATE AFFECT WITH ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. PARTICULARLY, WE EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY ON THE FORMATION OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS. FINALLY, SINCE AFFECT AND EMOTIONS CAN ALSO BE RELATED WITH SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, WE ANALYZE WHETHER DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITIES INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION THROUGH THE MEDIATION EFFECT OF SOCIAL NETWORKS. USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING, WE CONFIRM THE IMPACT OF BOTH ONLINE AND FACE-TO-FACE SOCIAL NETWORKS, AS WELL AS POSITIVE DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY ON ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION FOR 589 HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS IN SPAIN. HOWEVER, NEGATIVE DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY IS NOT SEEN TO INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. FURTHERMORE, BOTH FACE-TO-FACE AND ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE INFLUENCED BY POSITIVE DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY. MOREOVER, THESE TWO TYPES OF NETWORKS CAN EVEN PARTIALLY MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POSITIVE DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY AND ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. POSITIVE DISPOSITIONAL AFFECTIVITY CAN THUS INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS: DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH BOTH FACE-TO-FACE AND ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A GAP OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING LITERACY PRACTICES IN DENTAL EDUCATION. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY WHAT CHARACTERIZES DENTAL STUDENTS NOTETAKING AND SECONDARILY TO DETERMINE WHAT DENTAL STUDENTS EXPRESS REGARDING THEIR NOTETAKING. METHODS: TO ANALYZE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE PURPOSES OF NOTETAKING AND TO EXAMINE THEIR WRITTEN NOTES IN DEPTH, THREE VOLUNTEER STUDENTS, OUT OF THE 24 STUDENTS THAT VOLUNTARILY AND ANONYMOUSLY HANDED IN THEIR NOTES, WERE INTERVIEWED. THE THREE UNDERGRADUATE DENTAL STUDENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THIS MATERIAL-BASED, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW STUDY, FRAMED WITHIN A NEW LITERACY STUDIES APPROACH, WERE ON THEIR THIRD YEAR (6TH SEMESTER). THE FOCUS OF THESE MATERIAL-BASED INTERVIEWS WAS ON EACH STUDENTS NOTES. QUESTIONS PREPARED FOR SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE OPEN-ENDED AND ALLOWED FOR INDIVIDUAL FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE INTERVIEWEES ANSWER. TO ANALYZE THE OUTCOME OF THE INTERVIEWS A THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED. RESULTS: FROM THE MATERIAL-BASED INTERVIEWS EIGHT THEMES THAT RELATE TO WHAT, HOW AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE STUDENTS WRITE WERE DISCERNED. THESE EIGHT THEMES INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL VOCABULARY, CORE CONTENT AS WELL AS CLINICAL EXAMPLES THAT BELONG TO WHAT STUDENTS READ AND WRITE; MULTIMODAL ACCENTUATION AS WELL AS SYNTHESIS THAT BELONG TO HOW STUDENTS READ AND WRITE; AND MNEMONIC STRATEGIES, ACADEMIC PURPOSES, AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES THAT BELONG TO FOR WHAT PURPOSE STUDENTS READ AND WRITE. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THE INTERVIEWS INDICATE THAT THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT, OFFERING A VARIETY OF AVAILABLE TOOLS, HAS EXPANDED THE NOTION OF NOTETAKING. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED THAT DENTAL STUDENTS NOTETAKING HAS CHANGED DURING THEIR EDUCATION FROM INITIALLY BEING SYNCHRONOUS, TO ALSO INCLUDE MULTIMODAL AND ASYNCHRONOUS WRITING, MAKING NOTETAKING MORE OF A WRITING PRACTICE. FURTHER, STUDENTS WRITING PRACTICES SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE FORMATION IN RELATION TO A SUBJECT MATTER, BUT ALSO IN RELATION TO THEIR EXPERIENCES DURING CLINICAL TRAINING. ALTHOUGH, OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF NOTETAKING AND WRITING WAS TO PASS THEIR COURSE EXAMINATIONS, THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT STUDENTS THAT WERE HALF-WAY THROUGH THEIR DENTAL EDUCATION, ARE AWARE THAT LITERACY PRACTICES ARE FOR LEARNING FOR THEIR FUTURE PROFESSION, AND NOT ONLY FOR PASSING THEIR EXAMS. 2020, THE AUTHOR(S).",2020,CHARACTERISTICS OF DENTAL NOTE TAKING: A MATERIAL BASED THEMED ANALYSIS OF SWEDISH DENTAL STUDENTS,0

THE GOAL OF THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF USING OF DIGITAL TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES BY STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN PROBLEMS AND RISKS OF DIGITALIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THE KEY PROBLEM OF DIGITALIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN RUSSIA IS THE APPROVAL OF A TECHNOCRATIC MODEL FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION, BASED ON THE REDUCTION OF THIS PROCESS TO ""DIGITIZATION"". THE REAL GOAL OF DIGITALIZATION IN UNIVERSITIES SHOULD GIVE EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING THE CREATIVE NATURE OF EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH THE DIGITALIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION, AN ONLINE SURVEY OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS OF THE KAZAN (VOLGA) FEDERAL DISTRICT WAS USED. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS USE A LIMITED NUMBER OF DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES.

THIS STUDY IMPLEMENTS AN ADVANCED APPLICATION OF THE WEBOMETRIC APPROACH, EXPLOITING ALL THE THREE CATEGORIES OF WEB MINING: WEB CONTENT MINING; WEB STRUCTURE MINING; WEB USAGE MINING. THE INFORMATION TO COMPUTE OUR INDICATORS HAS BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE UNIVERSITIES' WEBSITES BY USING WEB SCRAPING AND TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES. THE SCRAPED INFORMATION HAS BEEN STORED IN A NOSQL DB ACCORDING TO A SEMI-STRUCTURED FORM TO ALLOW FOR RETRIEVING INFORMATION EFFICIENTLY BY TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES. THIS PROVIDES INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN THE DESIGN OF NEW INDICATORS, OPENING THE DOOR TO NEW TYPES OF ANALYSES. SOME DATA HAVE ALSO BEEN COLLECTED BY MEANS OF BATCH INTERROGATIONS OF SEARCH ENGINES (BING, WWW.BING.COM) OR FROM A LEADING PROVIDER OF WEB ANALYTICS (SIMILARWEB, HTTP://WWW.SIMILARWEB.COM). THE INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM THE WEB HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH THE UNIVERSITY STRUCTURAL INFORMATION TAKEN FROM THE EUROPEAN TERTIARY EDUCATION REGISTER (HTTPS://ETER.JOANNEUM.AT/#/HOME), A DATABASE COLLECTING INFORMATION ON HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (HEIS) AT EUROPEAN LEVEL. ALL THE ABOVE WAS USED TO PERFORM A CLUSTERIZATION OF 79 ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES BASED ON STRUCTURAL AND DIGITAL INDICATORS. THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CONCERN THE EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL IN DIGITALIZATION OF UNIVERSITIES, IN PARTICULAR BY PRESENTING TECHNIQUES FOR THE AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF INFORMATION FROM THE WEB TO BUILD INDICATORS OF QUALITY AND IMPACT OF UNIVERSITIES' WEBSITES. THESE INDICATORS CAN COMPLEMENT TRADITIONAL INDICATORS AND CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY GROUPS OF UNIVERSITIES WITH COMMON FEATURES USING CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES WORKING WITH THE ABOVE INDICATORS. THE RESULTS REPORTED IN THIS STUDY REFERS TO ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES ONLY, BUT THE APPROACH COULD BE EXTENDED TO OTHER UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ABROAD. THE APPROACH PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY AND ITS ILLUSTRATION ON ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES SHOW THE USEFULNESS OF RECENTLY INTRODUCED AUTOMATIC DATA EXTRACTION AND WEB SCRAPING APPROACHES AND ITS PRACTICAL RELEVANCE FOR CHARACTERIZING AND PROFILING THE ACTIVITIES OF UNIVERSITIES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR WEBSITES. THE APPROACH COULD BE APPLIED TO OTHER UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS.

UNDERSTANDING THE TYPES OF HEALTH INFORMATION SOUGHT ONLINE AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE INFORMATION-SEEKING YOUNG ADULTS IS VITAL WHEN DESIGNING DIGITAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR THEM. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DESCRIBE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUNG ADULTS LIVING WITH HIV WHO SEEK HEALTH INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERNET. RESULTS WILL BE RELEVANT TO DIGITAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND PATIENT EDUCATION. METHODS: YOUNG ADULTS WITH HIV (AGED 18-34 YEARS) SELF-REPORTED INTERNET USE DURING AN EVALUATION OF DIGITAL HIV CARE INTERVENTIONS ACROSS 10 DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN THE UNITED STATES (N=716). LASSO (LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR) MODELS WERE USED TO SELECT CHARACTERISTICS THAT PREDICTED WHETHER PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SEEKING GENERAL HEALTH AND SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (SRH) INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET DURING THE PAST 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: ALMOST A THIRD (211/716, 29.5%) AND A FIFTH (155/716, 21.6%) OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SEARCHING FOR GENERAL HEALTH AND SRH INFORMATION, RESPECTIVELY; 26.7% (36/135) OF TRANSGENDER YOUNG ADULTS WITH HIV SEARCHED FOR GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE TOPICS.

WE DEVELOPED A SMARTPHONE APP TO MEASURE TREATMENT RESPONSE. OBJECTIVE: BECAUSE THE EMPLOYMENT OF AN APP TO MEASURE TREATMENT RESPONSE IN IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IS RELATIVELY NEW, WE AIMED TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' ADHERENCE TO DIARY USE AND CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE. METHODS: A SMARTPHONE APP WAS DEVELOPED TO SERVE AS A SYMPTOM DIARY. PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (BASED ON ROME IV CRITERIA) WERE INSTRUCTED TO FILL OUT END-OF-DAY DIARY QUESTIONNAIRES DURING AN 8-WEEK TREATMENT. ADDITIONAL ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSED DEMOGRAPHICS, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME SYMPTOM SEVERITY, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL COMORBIDITIES. ADHERENCE RATE TO THE DIARY WAS DEFINED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF DAYS COMPLETED OUT OF TOTAL DAYS. ADHERENCE TO THE ADDITIONAL WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRES WAS ALSO ASSESSED. RESULTS: OVERALL, 189 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED (AGE: MEAN 34.0 YEARS, SD 13.3 YEARS; FEMALE: 147/189, 77.8%; MALE: 42/189, 22.2%). THE MEAN ADHERENCE RATE WAS 87.9% (SD 9.4%). HOWEVER, ADHERENCE TO THE DIARY DECREASED OVER TIME (P<.001). NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN ADHERENCE AND GENDER (P=.84), AGE (P=.22), OR EDUCATION LEVEL (LOWER EDUCATION LEVEL: P=.58, MIDDLE EDUCATION LEVEL: P=.46, VERSUS HIGH EDUCATION LEVEL), WHILE HIGHER ANXIETY SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ADHERENCE (P=.03). ADHERENCE TO THE ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRES WAS ALSO HIGH (>99%). MISSING DATA DUE TO TECHNICAL ISSUES WERE LIMITED. CONCLUSIONS: THE USE OF A SMARTPHONE APP AS A SYMPTOM DIARY TO ASSESS TREATMENT RESPONSE RESULTED IN HIGH PATIENT ADHERENCE.

"CHALLENGES IN ACCEPTANCE AND COMPLIANCE IN DIGITAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS DURING PREGNANCY: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY COMPLIANCE;  DIGITAL ASSESSMENTS;  EHEALTH;  PREGNANCY NA BACKGROUND: PREGNANT WOMEN ARE INCREASINGLY USING MOBILE APPS TO ACCESS HEALTH INFORMATION DURING THE ANTENATAL PERIOD. THEREFORE, DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS CAN POTENTIALLY BE USED AS MONITORING INSTRUMENTS DURING PREGNANCY. HOWEVER, A MAIN FACTOR OF SUCCESS IS HIGH USER ENGAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE ENGAGEMENT AND FACTORS INFLUENCING COMPLIANCE IN A LONGITUDINAL STUDY TARGETING PREGNANT WOMEN USING A DIGITAL HEALTH APP WITH SELF-TRACKING. METHODS: DIGITALLY COLLECTED DATA CONCERNING DEMOGRAPHICS, MEDICAL HISTORY, TECHNICAL ASPECTS, AND MENTAL HEALTH FROM 585 PREGNANT WOMEN WERE ANALYZED. PATIENTS FILLING OUT 80% OF ITEMS AT EVERY STUDY VISIT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE HIGHLY COMPLIANT. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH COMPLIANCE WERE IDENTIFIED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING ON COMPLIANCE WAS ASSESSED USING A ONE-SAMPLE T TEST. RESULTS: ONLY 25% OF PATIENTS COULD BE CONSIDERED COMPLIANT. OVERALL, 63% LEFT AT LEAST ONE VISIT BLANK. INFLUENTIAL VARIABLES FOR HIGHER ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED HIGHER EDUCATION, HIGHER INCOME, PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE, NONSMOKING, AND GERMAN ORIGIN. THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL COMPLAINTS OR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND STUDY DROPOUT. CONCLUSIONS: MAINTAINING HIGH ENGAGEMENT WITH DIGITAL MONITORING DEVICES OVER A LONG TIME REMAINS CHALLENGING.

THOSE EDUCATION METHODS FOCUS ON TEXTBOOK TEACHING AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND THE CONTENTS ARE TOO PROFESSIONAL. THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL BETWEEN EDUCATORS AND THE PUBLIC. THUS, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A VISUAL REPRESENTATION METHOD OF LANDSLIDE DISASTERS FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE PREPARED A CONCEPT MAP TO ORGANIZE AND REPRESENT BITS OF KNOWLEDGE OF LANDSLIDE, INSTANTIATING NODES OF CONCEPT MAP AS ANIMATION, THEN USED ANIMATION TO PUBLICIZE.

THE INTERACTIVE APP INTERAKTOR HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE SYMPTOM BURDEN DURING CANCER TREATMENT. IT INCLUDES SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT, AN ALERT SYSTEM FOR CONTACT WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, ACCESS TO SELF-CARE ADVICE, AND VISUALIZATION OF SYMPTOM HISTORY. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIGITAL INTERVENTIONS OPERATE; ONE APPROACH IS TO EXAMINE ENGAGEMENT BY ASSESSING USAGE AND EXPLORING USER EXPERIENCES. ACTUAL USAGE IN RELATION TO THE INTENDED USE-ADHERENCE-IS AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR OF ENGAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTERAKTOR APP AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST OR PROSTATE CANCER DURING TREATMENT. METHODS: PATIENTS FROM THE INTERVENTION GROUPS OF TWO SEPARATE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED: PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER RECEIVING NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY (N=74) AND PATIENTS WITH LOCALLY ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER RECEIVING TREATMENT WITH RADIOTHERAPY (N=75). THE PATIENTS REPORTED THEIR SYMPTOMS DAILY. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM BASELINE QUESTIONNAIRES AND MEDICAL RECORDS. LOGGED DATA USAGE WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE SERVER AND ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY AND WITH MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS. TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH PATIENTS ABOUT THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF USING THE APP AND ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN ADHERENCE PERCENTAGE TO DAILY SYMPTOM REPORTING WAS 83%. MOST PATIENTS USED THE SELF-CARE ADVICE AND FREE TEXT MESSAGE COMPONENT. AMONG THE PATIENTS TREATED FOR BREAST CANCER, HIGHER AGE PREDICTED A HIGHER TOTAL NUMBER OF FREE TEXT MESSAGES SENT (P=.04). AMONG THE PATIENTS TREATED FOR PROSTATE CANCER, HIGHER AGE (P=.01) AND HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL (P=.04), PREDICTED AN INCREASE IN TOTAL VIEWS ON SELF-CARE ADVICE, WHILE HIGHER COMORBIDITY (P=.004) PREDICTED A DECREASE IN TOTAL VIEWS ON SELF-CARE ADVICE. BEING MARRIED OR LIVING WITH A PARTNER PREDICTED A HIGHER ADHERENCE TO DAILY SYMPTOM REPORTING (P=.02). DAILY SYMPTOM REPORTING CREATED FEELINGS OF HAVING CONTINUOUS CONTACT WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, BEING ACKNOWLEDGED, AND SAFE. BEING CONTACTED BY A NURSE AFTER A SYMPTOM ALERT WAS CONSIDERED CONVENIENT AND HIGHLY VALUED. TREATMENT AND TIME-RELATED ASPECTS INFLUENCED ENGAGEMENT. DAILY SYMPTOM REPORTING WAS PERCEIVED AS PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL AT THE BEGINNING OF TREATMENT. REQUESTS WERE MADE FOR ADVICE ON DIET AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, AS WELL AS FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND DETAILED INFORMATION AS THE PATIENT PROGRESSED THROUGH TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENT ENGAGEMENT IN THE INTERACTIVE APP INTERAKTOR WAS HIGH. THE APP PROMOTED PATIENT PARTICIPATION IN THEIR CARE THROUGH CONTINUOUS AND CONVENIENT CONTACT WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES DIFFERED BETWEEN PATIENT GROUPS, BUT HIGHER AGE AND A HIGHER EDUCATIONAL LEVEL PREDICTED HIGHER USAGE OF SPECIFIC APP FUNCTIONS FOR BOTH PATIENT GROUPS.

DIGITAL BADGES REPRESENT AN INNOVATIVE INSTRUCTION STRATEGY INVOLVING THE CREDENTIALING OF COMPETENCIES TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR ACHIEVEMENT. DESPITE INCREASING INTEREST IN DIGITAL BADGES, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYNTHESIS OF THE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION LITERATURE REGARDING THIS CREDENTIALING STRATEGY. THE PRESENT AUTHORS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THIS GAP BY CONDUCTING THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF DIGITAL BADGES IN HEALTH CARE EDUCATION, TO REVEAL PEDAGOGICAL AND RESEARCH LIMITATIONS, AND TO PROVIDE AN EVIDENCE-BASED FOUNDATION FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL BADGES. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF THE MEDICAL EDUCATION LITERATURE FROM JANUARY 2008 TO MARCH 2019 WAS CONDUCTED USING MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CAB ABSTRACTS AND SCIENCEDIRECT. INCLUDED STUDIES DESCRIBED DIGITAL BADGES IN ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMMES IN ANY HEALTH CARE PROFESSION. INCLUDED STUDIES WERE APPRAISED AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT, METHODOLOGICAL SCORING, QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AND THEMATIC EXTRACTION WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1050 RELEVANT RECORDS WERE SCREENED FOR INCLUSION; 201 FULL TEXT ARTICLES WERE THEN ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF 30 INDEPENDENT PAPERS FOR ANALYSIS. ALL RECORDS HAD BEEN PUBLISHED SINCE 2013; 77% WERE JOURNAL ARTICLES, AND 83% INVOLVED ACADEMIC HEALTH CARE EDUCATION PROGRAMMES. SCORES FOR QUALITY WERE RELATIVELY MODERATE. THEMATIC ANALYSES REVEALED IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL BADGES: LEARNER CHARACTERISTICS MAY MODERATE STUDENT OUTCOMES; THE NOVELTY EFFECT CAN NEGATE THE VALUE OF DIGITAL BADGES, AND EDUCATORS MAY OVERCOME INSTRUCTION-RELATED CHALLENGES WITH DIGITAL BADGES USING DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES SUCH AS THE CREATION OF BADGING ECOSYSTEMS. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE A GROWING MOMENTUM FOR THE USE OF DIGITAL BADGES AS AN INNOVATIVE INSTRUCTION AND CREDENTIALING STRATEGY WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR OUTCOMES WITHIN A LEARNER-CENTRED, COMPETENCY-BASED MODEL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION. THERE IS A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CREDENTIALING SYSTEM IN HEALTH CARE EDUCATION.

THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE WAS TO BUILD ON THE RESEARCH ABOUT DESIGN PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE TEACHERS IN CONSTRUCTING E-COURSES, ENABLING IN-DEPTH LEARNING IN HYBRID LEARNING SPACES. THE PEDAGOGICAL DESIGN WAS GUIDED BY SIXDESIGN PRINCIPLES. EMPIRICAL DATA (21 STUDENTS ASSIGNMENTS AND REFLECTIONS, TEACHERS OBSERVATIONS, DATA FROM THE DIGITAL LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) WERE COLLECTED IN TWO RESEARCH CYCLES. STUDENTS WERE FROM DIFFERENT DEGREE PROGRAMMES OF EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF STUDENTS INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLABORATIVELY AUTHORED ASSIGNMENTS WAS CARRIED OUT IN BOTH RESEARCH CYCLES. THE MOST EMPHASISED BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES CONCERNED THE COMBINATION OF WORKING AND CREATING KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER, VIRTUALLY, IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP. BASED ON THE RESULTS, PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE FOR UNIVERSITY-LEVEL PEDAGOGICAL DESIGNS THAT FACILITATE EFFECTIVE AND ACTIVE COLLABORATION AND INTERACTION, AND LEARNING OF SUCH COMPETENCE.

EXISTING DEFINITIONS AND PERSPECTIVES IN THIS AREA GO BEYOND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS OR MEDIA FOR THE CREATION OF A DIGITAL LITERACY MINDSET, WHICH DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT ONE'S LIFE. HOWEVER, HIGHER EDUCATION STRATEGIES HAVE NOT YET CAUGHT UP WITH THIS AGENDA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A STUDENT SURVEY WITH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDENTS FROM THREE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN SCOTLAND, IRELAND AND GREECE WAS CONDUCTED AS A BASIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA TO SUPPORT THE THEORETICAL PROPOSITIONS OF THE STUDY. THE SURVEY CENTRED ON THE TECHNICAL AND HIGHER-LEVEL DIGITAL COMPETENCES OF STUDENTS AND DRAWING FROM STUDENTS' SELF-PERCEIVED DIGITAL COMPETENCES FOR LEARNING AND FOR THE EVERYDAY LIFE DIGITAL CONTEXT, ADDRESSING E-LEISURE, E-LEARNING, E-DEMOCRACY, E-GOVERNMENT AND E-HEALTH ACTIVITIES. THE SURVEY CRITICALLY ENABLED STUDENTS TO ASSESS DIGITAL COMPETENCES FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVES AS DIGITAL PARTICIPANTS. FINDINGS: STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES WERE LACKING IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, WHICH INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION LITERACY, DIGITAL CREATION, DIGITAL RESEARCH AND DIGITAL IDENTITY MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS' DIGITAL COMPETENCES WERE FOUND TO BE LINKED TO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE EVERYDAY LIFE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT.

IT IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PROBLEMS INHERENT IN ALL FORMS AND LEVELS OF EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN E-LEARNING. IT CAN BE PARTIALLY SOLVED THROUGH GAMIFICATION. IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, GAMIFICATION IS A RECOGNIZED TECHNOLOGY HAVING METHODOLOGICAL AND DIDACTIC ADVANTAGES; IT HAS BEEN ACTIVELY STUDIED AND USED FOR MANY YEARS. IN RUSSIA, THIS PROMISING AND POPULAR TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AND STARTED DEVELOPING ONLY RECENTLY. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST STUDIES ON GAMIFICATION (BOTH RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN) TEND TO FOCUS ON ITS STIMULUS-RESPONSE PATTERNS WITHOUT DELVING INTO ITS MOTIVATIONAL CAPABILITIES UNDERLYING ITS EFFICIENCY. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL MOTIVATIONS AND THEIR ROLE IN GAMIFICATION TO CREATE A LONG-TERM AND SUSTAINABLE EFFECT. OUR RESEARCH INTENDS TO MAKE A THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION TO THIS FIELD. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE LOOK INTO GAMIFICATION IN TERMS OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND CULTURAL APPROACHES AND ANALYZE MOTIVATION THEORIES WITH REGARD TO GAMIFICATION. WE WILL USE THE KEY CONCEPTS OF PHILOSOPHY OF PRAGMATISM AND SOCIAL PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY (SDT), THE FLOW THEORY AND THE TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS (TA) AS A THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK. THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS THAT WE TOOK AS A THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL BASIS HAVE NEVER BEEN USED IN GAMIFICATION ANALYSIS. THUS, THEY REPRESENT SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY OF OUR RESEARCH. BASED ON THE RESEARCH RESULTS, THE AUTHORS SUBSTANTIATE THE THESIS THAT INTRINSIC MOTIVATION PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL (BUT NOT AN EXCLUSIVE!) ROLE IN GAMIFICATION. IT IS GAME THINKING THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE FORMATION OF INTERNAL MOTIVATION, IN CONTRAST TO THE GAME MECHANICS ('POINTS, BADGES AND LEADERBOARDS'), WHICH IS FOCUSED ON EXTERNAL MOTIVATION. SHOWED THAT GAMIFICATION IS QUITE A CHALLENGING TECHNOLOGY; WHEN IT IS USED, PRIORITY ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO MAINTAINING THE BALANCE BETWEEN ITS UTILITARIAN (EDUCATIONAL) AND HEDONIC (RECREATIONAL) FUNCTIONS. IN GAMIFICATION, AS DISTINCT FROM ANY GAMES (REAL AND DIGITAL), ENTERTAINMENT IS A METHOD RATHER THAN A PURPOSE; FORGETTING THIS OBVIOUS FACT IS FRAUGHT WITH NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.

ALTHOUGH THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED, FEW LARGE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND CHRONIC PAIN IN YOUNG ADULTS. WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FREQUENCY, INTENSITY AND DURATION OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, AND CHRONIC PAIN. METHODS DATA STEM FROM THE SHOT2018-STUDY, A NATIONAL HEALTH SURVEY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN NORWAY, IN WHICH 36,625 FULLTIME STUDENTS AGED 18-35 YEARS COMPLETED ALL RELEVANT QUESTIONNAIRES. CHRONIC PAIN, DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES 11TH REVISION (ICD-11), WAS ASSESSED WITH A NEWLY DEVELOPED HIERARCHICAL DIGITAL INSTRUMENT FOR REPORTING BOTH DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PAIN IN PREDEFINED BODY REGIONS. PHYSICAL EXERCISE WAS ASSESSED USING THREE SETS OF QUESTIONS, MEASURING THE NUMBER OF TIMES EXERCISING EACH WEEK, AND THE AVERAGE INTENSITY AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS EACH TIME. RESULTS THE MAJORITY (54%) OF THE STUDENTS REPORTED CHRONIC PAIN IN AT LEAST ONE LOCATION, AND THE PREVALENCE WAS ESPECIALLY HIGH AMONG WOMEN. THE OVERALL PATTERN WAS AN INVERSE DOSERESPONSE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXERCISE AND CHRONIC PAIN: THE MORE FREQUENT, HARDER OR LONGER THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE, THE LOWER THE RISK OF CHRONIC PAIN. SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE GENERALLY ALSO OBSERVED FOR THE NUMBER OF PAIN LOCATIONS: FREQUENT EXERCISE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER PAIN LOCATIONS. ADJUSTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICAL, LIFESTYLE FACTORS AND DEPRESSION HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ASSOCIATIONS. CONCLUSION GIVEN THE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS OF REGULAR EXERCISE, THERE IS MUCH TO BE GAINED IN FACILITATING COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TO BE MORE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE, IDEALLY, THRU A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN POLITICAL AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

METHODS OF THE STUDY WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY BY USING THE GOOGLE CHROME ELECTRONIC SERVICE, CONTENT ANALYSIS, METHODS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, AND A FOCUS GROUP. THE AUTHORS VERSION OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS MADE BY USING THE LIKERT METHODOLOGY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INDICATORS OF THE QS WORLD UNIVERSITY RANKINGS RATING SYSTEM. THE DATA OBTAINED DURING THE THREE STAGES WERE GENERALIZED AND ANALYZED BY USING THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS. THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOTIVES OF THE ACADEMIC STAFF (AS) AND THE NATURE OF THE STIMULATING EFFECT OF THE UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES ON THE STAFF OF THE UNIVERSITY. RESULTS: THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE AS MOTIVATION STRUCTURE AND THE RANGE OF STIMULATION METHODS APPLIED BY THE UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES, A CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN THE BURDEN FROM INTRODUCED INNOVATIONS, AND THE FORMAL STYLE FOR EMPLOYEES TO FULFILL NEW TASKS HAVE BEEN REVEALED. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS ON USING THE TECHNIQUES AND METHODS BY THE UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES TO MOTIVATE AND STIMULATE THE STAFF HAS SHOWN THE NEED IN NEW COMBINATORICS, AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM THAT HARMONIOUSLY COMBINES THE ADVANTAGES OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO MOTIVATE THE AS IN TRAINING HR FOR THE DIGITAL ECONOMY OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THE NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL AND FLEXIBLY RESPOND TO CONSTANT CHANGES IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO TIMELY ELIMINATE THE CONTRADICTIONS IN NEEDS AND TEACHERS OPINION ON THE IDEAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND OFFERED FORMS OF STIMULATION BY UNIVERSITIES AUTHORITIES. THE VECTORS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES MUST BE CONSTANTLY COORDINATED, BASED ON THE AI CAPABILITIES. THE INTRODUCTION OF AI IN THE ACTIVITIES OF UNIVERSITIES IMPROVES THE COMPETITIVENESS OF PROMISING, INNOVATIVE TEACHERS AND HAS POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE IMAGE, EFFICIENCY, ACADEMIC REPUTATION, AND CITATION INDEX OF UNIVERSITIES. THE AUTHORS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER HAVE STUDIED THE PROBLEMS OF USING THE AI IN THE MOTIVATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSITYS AS AND OFFERED TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF UNIVERSITIES BY USING THE MOTIVATIONAL AI. THE PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM IS RELATED TO THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING THE OFFERED TECHNOLOGIES BY THE UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES THAT STRIVE TO IMPROVE THEIR EFFICIENCY AND COMPETITIVENESS IN THE EDUCATIONAL MARKET. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF THE WORK IS RELATED TO THE ADVANCED SOLUTIONS OF THE EMERGING PROBLEMS ON USING THE AI IN MOTIVATING THE UNIVERSITY STAFF IDENTIFIED DURING THE THREE-STAGE STUDY.

HOWEVER, ADOPTING THIS PROCESS-ORIENTATED PRACTICE INTO HIGHER EDUCATION RAISES ETHICAL CONCERNS ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO THE NORMATIVE APPROACH TO TRADITIONAL RESEARCH. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO EXPLORE THE ETHICAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING DST WHEN USED AS A PEDAGOGY AND TO DETERMINE IF AN 'ETHICS OF CARE' APPROACH COULD HELP TO MITIGATE THE ETHICAL DILEMMAS EXPERIENCED BY TEACHERS AND RESEARCHERS ALIKE. METHOD: A SINGLE CASE STUDY, NARRATIVES, ILLUSTRATIONS AND REFLECTIONS FROM A FINAL-YEAR ARTS EDUCATION PROJECT WERE USED TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE ETHICAL ISSUES WE ENCOUNTERED WHEN EMPLOYING DST AS A PEDAGOGY AND IN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF THIS REFLECTION SHOW THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE PAID TO THE FOLLOWING ISSUES: THE COLLECTION AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA, HOW ANONYMITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY ARE ENSURED IN DST, WHO OWNS THE STORIES, HOW SAMPLING IS CONDUCTED AND HOW CONSENT IS SOUGHT AND, FINALLY, HOW THE TENANT OF 'DO NO HARM' IS ADHERED TO IN DST.

AS A RESULT, UNIVERSITIES WHICH EDUCATE LOCAL LEADERS FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE NATIONAL ECONOMIES AND HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS THE COMPOSITION OF THE LABOR MARKET AND INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL, OFTEN ENCOUNTER NEGATIVE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. THE REFORMS THAT ARE IMPOSED BY THE POLICYMAKERS ""FROM ABOVE"" OFTEN HAMPER THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNIVERSITIES AND PREVENT THEM FROM FULFILLING THEIR ROLES DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE PROCESS OF REFORMING HIGHER EDUCATION IN RUSSIA IS IN MANY WAYS SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, IN PARTICULAR IN POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITION ECONOMIES. FIRSTLY, THIS PROCESS WENT THROUGH THE INTEGRATION INTO THE GLOBAL MARKET OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. SECONDLY, IT PROCEEDED WITH THE RETHINKING OF THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY AS A SELF-SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION. THIRDLY, IT WAS CONCLUDED BY AN INCREASE IN THE DEMAND AND ACCESSIBILITY OF EDUCATION USING THE ADVANCEMENTS OFFERED BY THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. OUR PAPER ARGUES THAT FOCUSED AND WELL-BALANCED ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF REORGANIZED LEADING UNIVERSITIES. THE PROJECT PERSPECTIVE IMPLIES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AN INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN IN RELATION TO WHAT THE ORGANIZATION SEEKS TO ACHIEVE (EITHER AS ITS REGULATOR OR REFORMER) AND HOW IT INTENDS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES OF DESIGNING EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF REORGANIZED UNIVERSITIES: (I) PRESERVATION OF EDUCATION AS A ""MIXED"" GOOD (I.E., ONE THAT HAS THE FEATURES OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE GOODS); (II) TRANSPARENCY OF DECISION MAKING; (III) COMPLEMENTARITY OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST (IV) REDUCTION IN TRANSACTION COSTS. 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.",2020,LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS DESIGN IN THE CONTEXT OF EDUCATION REFORMS,0

THE FOCUS OF THE STUDY INCLUDES THE BEHAVIOR OF ALL THOSE IN THIS MARKET FOR INFORMATION, NAMELY SUPPLIERS (WHETHER CONTENT GENERATORS, AGGREGATORS, PACKAGERS, OR DISTRIBUTORS OF CONTENT) OF MARKETING RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY STAFF, AND STUDENTS. THE CASE STUDY METHOD WAS IMPLEMENTED TO COLLECT DATA. THE CASE STUDY FOCUSES ON UK HIGHER EDUCATION. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS USE THE CASE STUDY OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED ARCHIVE OF MARKET AND SOCIAL RESEARCH (AMSR) TO EXPLORE HOW CONTENT RELATING TO MARKETING AND MARKET RESEARCH IS DISTRIBUTED TO AND WITHIN UNIVERSITIES. THE RESEARCH INVOLVED PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WITH 15 LIBRARIAN SENIOR MANAGERS SELECTED FROM 14 UNIVERSITIES. THE INTERVIEWS WITH LIBRARIANS PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO HOW AMSR COULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND HOW IT COULD BE ACCESSED. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITY ACADEMICS IN SPECIFYING THE CONTENT OF MARKETING AND MARKET RESEARCH. THEY FOCUS ON REAL WORLD MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS TO DELIVER RESEARCH WITH IMPACT AND RELEVANT TEACHING. THEREFORE, THEY NEED COMPANY AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE CURRENT SOURCES. THE STUDY MAPS THE PROCESS OF ACQUISITION OF MARKETING AND MARKET RESEARCH CONTENT BY UNIVERSITIES AND IDENTIFIES THE DIFFERENT ROLES INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. THE STUDY IS IN LINE WITH THE EMERGING LITERATURE THAT FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN EXPLAINING THE RELEVANCE GAP IN MARKETING RESEARCH. THE STUDY CONTRASTS BETWEEN THE SITUATION IN THE UNIVERSITY MARKET AND INDUSTRIAL BUYING AND ADDS TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MARKETING RESEARCH MATERIAL.

DURING FOUR SEMESTERS, WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS ON REFLECTIVE LEARNING DIARIES, WRITTEN BY 78 GRADUATE STUDENTS STUDYING EDUCATION (N = 1870 CODES). THE BOTTOM-UP ANALYSIS FOCUSED ON LEARNING PROCESSES THAT ENABLED THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS DIGITAL LITERACIES CONCEPTUALIZED BY THE DIGITAL LITERACY FRAMEWORK (DLF; ESHET-ALKALAI, 2012): PHOTO-VISUAL, INFORMATION, REPRODUCTION, BRANCHING, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL, AND REAL-TIME THINKING SKILLS. FURTHERMORE, FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF-REGULATION AND LEARNING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF DIGITAL LITERACIES. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL STATEMENTS EXPRESSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION THAT ENABLE STUDENTS TO COPE WITH A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP OVER LEARNING OUTCOMES, AND PRESENT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TEAMWORK: SHARING, COOPERATION, AND COLLABORATION. QUALITATIVE CODING PROVIDED A MORE GRANULATED PERSPECTIVE ON PERCEIVED LEARNING BY DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL RETROSPECTION DURING THE LEARNING PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING IS EXPECTED TO BE PERFORMED BY SMART FACTORIES, I.E. THE INDUSTRY 4.0, WHICH IS THE OUTCOME OF STEADY DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH NEW OBJECTS AND SYSTEMS THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY SUPERVISE AND FULFIL MANUFACTURING TASKS. THE INDUSTRY 4.0 CONCEPT RELIES LARGELY ON THE ABILITY TO DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE SMART AND CONNECTED DEVICES THAT ARE BASED ON MICROELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY. THIS EVOLUTION REQUIRES HIGHLY-SKILLED TECHNICIANS, ENGINEERS AND PHDS, ALL OF THEM WELL PREPARED FOR RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING. THEIR TRAINING, WHICH COMBINES KNOWLEDGE AND THE ASSOCIATED COMPULSORY KNOW-HOW, IS BECOMING THE MAIN CHALLENGE FOR THE ACADEMIC WORLD. THE CURRICULA MUST THEREFORE INCLUDE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND ASSOCIATED KNOW-HOW TRAINING IN ALL THE SPECIALTIES OF THE FIELD.

HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE RESULTS, WHICH SUMMARIZE RELEVANT EDUCATIONAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL PERSPECTIVES, IT CAN BE NOTICED THAT THERE IS CONSENSUS ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF ONLY FOUR SKILLS: ICT, LITERACY AND NUMERACY, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BASIC, KEY OR CORE SKILLS IN MOST RESEARCHED PAPERS TOGETHER WITH PROBLEM SOLVING, WHICH IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS A COGNITIVE SKILL. THE GENERAL TENDENCY IS THAT POLICYMAKERS AND ACADEMIA FOCUS ON SOME PARTICULAR DOMAINS: BASIC/KEY, CORE/GLOBAL FOUNDATION/FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS, TRANSFERABLE, TRANSVERSAL AND OTHER SKILLS. STUDIES ANALYSING THE WORKFORCE SKILL REQUIREMENTS HAVE PROJECTED MAINLY COGNITIVE AND LEARNING SKILLS, WHEREAS MOBILITY PROGRAMMES CONCEDE RELEVANCE TO EMPLOYABILITY, MANAGEMENT, CAREER AND LIFE SKILLS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: MEASURING SKILLS INVOLVES LIMITATIONS AS RECORDS VARY DEPENDING ON CONTINUOUS EMERGING DATA FROM INSTITUTIONS, OCCUPATIONS AND EDUCATION. THE KEY FRAMEWORKS SURVEYED HAVE PROVIDED A REPRESENTATIVE CLASSIFICATION AND DEPICTION OF THE CURRENT SKILLS FROM SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVES WHICH ARE ALSO BELIEVED TO HAVE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS. IN COMBINATION, HOWEVER, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE RESULTS PRESENTED CAN HELP PROVIDE A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR ASSESSING SKILLS IN CREDIT MOBILITY AND ERASMUS PROGRAMMES WITHIN THE EHEA. THE RESULTING FRAMEWORK PRESENTS A FOUNDED BASIS FOR SKILLS APPRAISAL WHICH EXPECTS TO BE MEANINGFUL FOR VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND HELPS DETERMINE HOW MOBILITY POLICIES CAN HELP IMPROVE THE ATTAINMENT OF SKILLS IN THE EHEA. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT EDUCATION SYSTEMS WILL HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE LABOUR MARKETS' RESHAPING ROLES TO BALANCE TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTELLECT. THE WORKFORCE SEEMS TO REALIZE THAT COGNITIVE SKILLS SUCH AS PROBLEM SOLVING, ORGANIZATION AND DECISION-MAKING ARE NEEDED IN TODAY'S SOCIETY; ADVANCED BASIC LEARNING SKILLS SUCH AS NUMERACY AND LITERACY ARE ESSENTIAL. FINDINGS APPOINT TO NEW AREAS FOR EXPLORATION IN SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO PREPARE EUROPEAN HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS FOR CURRENT TRENDS IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE FUSION BETWEEN DIGITAL, PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SPHERES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: DATA SEEM TO CONFIRM THAT A SOLE DEGREE DOES NOT GUARANTEE SUCCESS, BUT THE MATURITY OF CERTAIN SKILLS AND THE COMMITMENT TO LIFELONG LEARNING. THIS CAN BE STRENGTHENED BY TAKING PART IN EHEA CREDIT STUDENT MOBILITY THAT HAS PROVED TO IMPROVE NOT ONLY BASIC AND LINGUISTIC SKILLS BUT ALSO SELF-DEVELOPMENT AND RESPECT FOR SEVERAL ASPECTS SUCH AS DIVERSITY AND (INTER)CULTURAL AWARENESS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PERCEPTIVE AND INTERPERSONAL ABILITIES MENTIONED IN REPORTS ON FUTURE SKILLS, IT SEEMS THAT EDUCATION WILL NEED FURTHER SUPPORT FOR UPDATED TEACHING PRACTICES AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SKILLS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE GREATER DEMAND, NAMELY STEM. INSTITUTIONS WILL NEED TO UPDATE AND PROMOTE THE TEACHING OF NEW SKILLS BASED ON A NEW COLLECTIVE AND MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS AS RECENTLY INDICATED IN OECD'S (2018) GLOBAL COMPETENCE IN ORDER TO MAKE FUTURE CITIZENS UNDERSTAND AND ACT ON ISSUES OF UNIVERSAL SIGNIFICANCE IN TODAY'S INTERCONNECTED WORLD. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: FOR SEVERAL DECADES, GOVERNMENT, EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY HAVE PROPOSED DIFFERENT OUTLINES FOR WHAT GRADUATES SHOULD KNOW AND BE ABLE TO DO. LIMITED ACADEMIC STUDIES HAVE BEEN FOUND, HOWEVER, WITH UPDATED CONCRETE DATA ON WHICH SKILLS SHOULD PREFERABLY BE DEVELOPED OR WHETHER AND HOW STUDENTS CAN FURTHER IMPROVE THESE SKILLS AS PART OF EHEA CREDIT STUDENT MOBILITY. THIS STUDY HAS SYNTHESIZED WORKS AND IDENTIFIED DOMAINS WHICH FEATURED THE IMPORTANCE OF GENERIC CORE, COGNITIVE AND EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS. THE REVISION OF SKILL FRAMEWORKS HAS UNDERSCORED EXISTING LITERATURE AND REPORTS ON FUTURE SKILLS WHICH ANTICIPATE THAT, IN ORDER TO CONFRONT THE EXPANDING AND PREVALENT ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY, GRADUATES WILL NEED TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING UNIQUE HUMAN SKILLS SUCH AS EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND CREATIVE INNOVATION, CRITICAL THINKING AND COLLECTIVE ETHICAL VALUES. 2019, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2020,SKILLS IN EUROPEAN HIGHER EDUCATION MOBILITY PROGRAMMES: OUTLINING A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK,0

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EXAMINE THE USE OF EHEALTH IN A POPULATION ABOVE 40 YEARS OF AGE, THE PREDICTORS OF EHEALTH USE, AND THE PREDICTORS OF TAKING ACTION FOLLOWING THE USE OF THESE EHEALTH SERVICES. METHODS: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A QUESTIONNAIRE GIVEN TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE SEVENTH SURVEY OF THE TROMS STUDY (TROMS 7). THE STUDY INVOLVED A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE NORWEGIAN POPULATION AGED ABOVE 40 YEARS OLD. A SUBSET OF THE MORE EXTENSIVE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS EXPLICITLY RELATED TO EHEALTH USE.

"ENABLING CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN ONLINE TEACHING AND LEARNING THROUGH E-LEARNING CAPABILITY AND MATURITY ASSESSMENT CMM;  DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION;  E-LEARNING MATURITY MODEL;  QUALITY ASSURANCE;  SPICE;  UNIVERSITY NA PURPOSE: THE UNIVERSITY OF MAURITIUS (UOM) ESTABLISHED AS A TRADITIONAL FACE-TO-FACE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN DISTANCE EDUCATION SINCE 1993 AND IN E-LEARNING SINCE 2001 TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AS A DUAL-MODE INSTITUTION. IN A CONTEXT WHERE IT HAS ENGAGED ITSELF TO PROMOTE ITS INTERNATIONALIZATION OF ONLINE COURSES AND A DIGITAL LEARNING TRANSFORMATION PROCESS, THERE IS A NEED TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE ITS CURRENT E-LEARNING CAPABILITY TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF GOOD PRACTICES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT TO ENSURE A HIGH QUALITY OF E-LEARNING PROVISIONS. THE PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE E-LEARNING CAPABILITY AND THE RELATED QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESSES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE MAURITIUS USING THE E-LEARNING MATURITY MODEL (EMM). QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS STILL A KEY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE EVER-GROWING INFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE DISRUPTION THAT THE INTERNET HAS CAUSED WITH RESPECT TO E-LEARNING AND DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVISIONS. NO UNIVERSITY IN MAURITIUS HAS EVER ENGAGED IN SUCH AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR E-LEARNING CAPABILITIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE EMM AND THE OPEN LEARNING CONSORTIUM QUALITY SCORECARD SUITE WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST COMPLETE MODELS IN TERMS OF AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION AND DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO CARRY OUT THE EVALUATION WITH RESPECT TO EACH PROCESS AREA AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER MODELS DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE REVIEW SECTION. THE EMM WAS, HOWEVER, CHOSEN AS THE MODEL TO BE USED FOR THE UOM, GIVEN THAT THERE ALREADY EXISTS A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ITS APPLICATIONS IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES THAT OPERATE IN SIMILAR CONTEXTS. THE RESEARCHER IS AT THE HEART OF THE PROCESS IN THE ROLE OF AN ELEARNING QUALITY AUDITOR. THEREFORE, THE RESEARCH USED MAINLY DESK STUDIES, AND ANALYSIS OF ANNUAL REPORTS AS WELL AS A CONSULTATIVE APPROACH WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON A CONSENSUS MODEL TO REACH A RATING FOR EACH ELEMENT IN THE EMMV2.3 INSTRUMENT. THE RATING IS BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND VERIFIABLE THROUGH DESK RESEARCH AND DOCUMENTATION. FINDINGS: WE FOUND OUT THAT THE MAIN STRENGTHS OF THE UNIVERSITY WERE IN THE LEARNING PROCESS AREAS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO FOLLOW EXISTING QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES IN PLACE AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF A COURSE OF LIFE CYCLE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COURSE MODALITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, ACROSS ALL PROCESS AREAS, THE UNIVERSITY FARED WELL IN THE DELIVERY DIMENSION, AND THIS FINDING IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES THAT WERE ASSESSED USING THE EMM. HOWEVER, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE EMM IN CURRENT FORM WAS MORE ADAPTED FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF UNIVERSITIES OPERATING FULLY AS OPEN OR VIRTUAL UNIVERSITIES RATHER THAN THOSE OPERATING AS DUAL-MODE INSTITUTIONS OR AS TRADITIONAL UNIVERSITIES PROMOTING TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED LEARNING. THE WEAKEST LINK WAS THE OPTIMIZATION DIMENSION ACROSS ALL PROCESS AREAS, AND THE PROCESS AREA THAT NEEDS MORE ATTENTION FOR IMPROVEMENT WAS THE EVALUATION PROCESS AREA.

THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER INTERVENTIONS CAN INCREASE ACCESS, BUT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA MAY IMPEDE THE USE OF STANDARD DIGITAL INTERVENTIONS. WE DEVELOPED AN INTERACTIVE, MULTIMEDIA, DIGITAL MOTIVATIONAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR SMOKERS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (LET'S TALK ABOUT SMOKING). WE ALSO DIGITALIZED A STANDARD EDUCATIONAL PAMPHLET FROM THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI EDUCATION). BOTH WERE TAILORED TO REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD DURING USE. OBJECTIVE: WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF LET'S TALK ABOUT SMOKING VERSUS NCI EDUCATION TO TEST WHETHER THE INTERACTIVE MOTIVATIONAL INTERVENTION WAS MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE APPEALING THAN THE STATIC EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION FOR INCREASING USE OF SMOKING CESSATION TREATMENT, QUIT ATTEMPTS, AND ABSTINENCE AMONG SMOKERS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA, ACCOUNTING FOR THE LEVEL OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING. METHODS: ADULT SMOKERS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (N=162) WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY FROM 2014 TO 2015, RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN INTERVENTION CONDITION, AND ASSESSED IN PERSON AT 3- AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. INTERVENTIONS WERE DELIVERED ON A LAPTOP COMPUTER IN A SINGLE SESSION. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD ACCESS TO STANDARD, COMMUNITY-DELIVERED CESSATION TREATMENTS DURING FOLLOW-UP. MULTIVARIATE MODELS WERE USED TO EVALUATE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: TREATMENT INITIATION OUTCOMES WERE NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN INTERVENTION CONDITIONS (27/84 [32%] FOR LET'S TALK ABOUT SMOKING VS 36/78 [46%] FOR NCI EDUCATION; ODDS RATIO [OR] 0.71 [95% CI 0.37-1.33]); 38.9% (63/162) OF PARTICIPANTS INITIATED TREATMENT.

QUIT ATTEMPTS (25/84, 30% VS 36/78, 46%; ESTIMATE [EST]=-0.093, SE 0.48; P=.85) AND ABSTINENCE (1/84, 1% VS 6/78, 7%; 21=3.4; P=.07) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN INTERVENTION CONDITIONS.

CONCLUSIONS: THE INTERACTIVE, MULTIMEDIA INTERVENTION WAS NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE STATIC, TEXT-BASED INTERVENTION AMONG SMOKERS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. BOTH TAILORED DIGITAL INTERVENTIONS RESULTED IN LEVELS OF TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT AND QUIT ATTEMPTS THAT WERE SIMILAR TO FINDINGS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES OF IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS, CONFIRMING THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF DIGITAL INTERVENTIONS TO EDUCATE AND MOTIVATE SMOKERS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO USE CESSATION TREATMENT AND TO QUIT SMOKING. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL CESSATION TREATMENT IS NEEDED AFTER BRIEF EDUCATION OR MOTIVATIONAL INTERVENTIONS, AND THAT CESSATION TREATMENT SHOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.

THE AIM WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT THAT MOOCS AND OTHER FREE OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS PROVIDE EQUITABLE FORMS OF ONLINE EDUCATION TO ADDRESS GLOBAL WIDENING PARTICIPATION AGENDAS. THE LITERATURE FELL INTO TWO MAIN GROUPS: EMPIRICAL REPORTS ON OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS, AND THOSE PROVIDING POLICY OR PRACTITIONER GUIDANCE. A GLOBALLY DIVERSE SET OF 46 STUDIES AND REPORTS WERE EXAMINED, INCLUDING 24 EMPIRICAL EVALUATIONS OF PROGRAMS REACHING OVER 440,000 DISADVANTAGED LEARNERS IN BOTH DISTANCE AND BLENDED LEARNING SETTINGS. MOST LITERATURE CLAIMED AN INTEREST IN ADVANCING STUDENT EQUITY (ENROLLED OR TERTIARY PREPARATION LEARNERS) AND/OR SOCIAL INCLUSION (COMMUNITY LEARNERS) WITH LOW-SKILLS, LOW CONFIDENCE, AND/OR LOW LEVELS OF PREVIOUS EDUCATION. IN CONTRAST TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE, THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THERE WAS A FLOURISHING OF MULTI-LINGUAL AND LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH (LOTE) PROGRAMS AND THOSE ADDRESSING REGIONAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE. MOST CASES INVOLVED MOOCS AND FREE ONLINE RESOURCES COMBINED WITH ADDITIONAL FORMS OF SUPPORT, INCLUDING FACE-TO-FACE STUDY GROUPS. CONTRARY TO THE EXISTING DEBATE IN THE OPEN EDUCATION LITERATURE, THE REVIEW ALSO FOUND THAT THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE LEARNING MATERIALS (COPYRIGHT OR OPENLY LICENCED) WAS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE SO LONG AS IT WAS FREE TO THE END USER. WHAT SEEMED TO MATTER MOST WAS THE INTENTIONAL AND COLLABORATIVE DESIGN FOR DISADVANTAGED COHORTS, INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF DIGITAL OR FACE-TO-FACE PERSONAL SUPPORT. SUCCESSFUL DESIGN COLLABORATIONS OFTEN FEATURED LEARNER-CENTRED, NON-TECHNICAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS WHICH INCREASED THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF PARTICULAR MARGINALISED LEARNERS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING MORE SUSTAINABLE AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNER SUPPORT.

ABSA S IS A SUB-DISCIPLINE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) THAT FOCUSSES ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF SENTIMENTS (NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE) AND ASPECTS (SENTIMENT TARGETS) IN A SENTENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM FOR ABSA OF FREE TEXT REVIEWS EXPRESSED IN STUDENT OPINION SURVEYS IN THE SERBIAN LANGUAGE. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE FINEST LEVEL OF TEXT GRANULARITY THE LEVEL OF SENTENCE SEGMENT (PHRASE AND CLAUSE). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE PRESENTED SYSTEM RELIES ON NLP TECHNIQUES, MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, RULES AND DICTIONARIES. THE CORPORA COLLECTED AND ANNOTATED FOR SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION COMPRISE STUDENTS REVIEWS OF TEACHING STAFF AT THE FACULTY OF TECHNICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF NOVI SAD, SERBIA, AND A CORPUS OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REVIEWS FROM THE SERBIAN EQUIVALENT OF THE RATE MY PROFESSORS WEBSITE. FINDINGS: THE RESEARCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT POSITIVE SENTIMENT CAN SUCCESSFULLY BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE F-MEASURE OF 0.83, WHILE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT CAN BE DETECTED WITH THE F-MEASURE OF 0.94. WHILE THE F-MEASURE FOR THE ASPECTS RANGE IS BETWEEN 0.49 AND 0.89, DEPENDING ON THEIR FREQUENCY IN THE CORPUS. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE QUALITY OF ABSA DEPENDS ON THE SOURCE OF THE REVIEWS (OFFICIAL STUDENTS SURVEYS VS REVIEW WEBSITES). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE SYSTEM FOR ABSA PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER COULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE SERBIAN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THROUGH A MORE EFFECTIVE SEARCH AND SUMMARY OF STUDENTS OPINIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A PARTICULAR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION COULD VERY EASILY FIND OUT WHICH ASPECTS OF THEIR SERVICE THE STUDENTS ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH AND TO WHICH ASPECTS OF THEIR SERVICE MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE DIRECTED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY OF ABSA CARRIED OUT AT THE LEVEL OF SENTENCE SEGMENT FOR THE SERBIAN LANGUAGE.

"RE-IMAGINING THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION IN THE ERA OF THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 4IR;  AJAGUNNA;  EDUCATION;  ILORI;  MARITIME NA PURPOSE: GLOBALLY, HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN, OVER THE YEARS, A SOURCE OF INNOVATION, POLICY, NEW KNOWLEDGE AND A NATIONAL ASSET. HOWEVER, THE ADVENT OF THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (4IR) IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING FROM PRIMARY TO TERTIARY LEVELS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CONSIDER HOW THE 4IR HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT EDUCATION AT THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF LEARNING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE PAPER AIMS TO BRIDGE THE PERCEIVED INFORMATION GAP AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION AND THE SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS THAT 4IR JOBS REQUIRE. IN RESPONSE, THE FOLLOWING ARE CONSIDERED: THE NEED TO TWEAK THE CURRICULUM, ADOPT THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY FOR IN CLASS AND ONLINE DELIVERY AND THE PROJECTION OF OTHER LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND SKILLS THAT ARE OFTEN NOT CONSIDERED PERTINENT. DATA GATHERING FOR THE REPORT WAS BY DISCUSSION WITH EXPERTS AND CONSULTATION OF RELEVANT ARTICLES AND WRITE-UPS FROM RELATED WEBSITES. FINDINGS: THE ADVENT OF SMART COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS INVOLVING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, INTERNET, ROBOTICS, VIRTUAL REALITY AND DIGITAL TEXTBOOKS HAS OPENED A NEW VISTA IN RELATION TO HOW AND WHAT IS LEARNT IN SCHOOLS. JUST AS TECHNOLOGIES BROUGHT ABOUT SMART COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, THE 4IR MODEL OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND AS SUCH, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW MUST BE DYNAMIC, AND IT MUST KEEP PACE WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND SKILLS REQUIRED IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: MORE PURPOSEFUL RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED IN UNIVERSITIES AND INDUSTRIES WITH THE INTENTION OF ACCELERATING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INNOVATIONS SO THAT MARKETS CAN BE EXPANDED. FURTHERMORE, EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE COST AND TIME OF GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL NEED TO BE INTENSIFIED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE VALUE AND EMPHASIS THAT ARE PLACED ON THE ACQUISITION OF DEGREES AND PAPER QUALIFICATIONS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY. ALTHOUGH IT IS TRADITIONAL FOR STUDENTS TO COMPETE FOR ADMISSION TO THE FACE-TO-FACE CLASSROOM MODEL, IT IS NO LONGER UNUSUAL FOR A STUDENT TO TAKE COURSES ONLINE FROM ANY PART OF THE WORLD AND STILL BE ACCEPTED INTO POSITIONS USUALLY RESERVED FOR TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM EDUCATION. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: AS AT TODAY, EXAMPLES OF 4IR SERVICES INCLUDE UBER, AIRBNB, CLOUD SERVICES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, CYBER-SECURITY, THREE-DIMENSIONAL PRINTERS, DRIVERLESS CARS AND ROBOTICS. MACHINE LEARNING AND DRONE TECHNOLOGY ARE ALSO OF GROWING SIGNIFICANCE. AS YET, SUBJECTS DEALING WITH SUCH INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS ARE NOT PART OF THE CURRICULUM OF MANY INSTITUTIONS AND THIS IS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE 4IR ERA WILL BRING GREAT CHANGES TO HOW STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT AND WHAT STUDENTS MUST LEARN AS THE TOOLS FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL LEARNING ARE ALREADY OVERWHELMING. JOBS WILL BE SCARCE FOR THOSE WITHOUT THE REQUISITE SKILLS, WHEREAS THOSE WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS WILL HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, OTHERWISE THEY TOO WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. SCHOOLS WILL INCREASINGLY BECOME CENTRES FOR THE GENERATION OF INNOVATION AND ITS INCUBATION AND IN ALL THIS, QUALITY LEARNING, TEACHING AND KNOWLEDGE IMPARTATION CAN EASILY BE CARRIED OUT ONLINE. 2020, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2020,RE-IMAGINING THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION IN THE ERA OF THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,0

THE AUTHORS HAVE CONSIDERED THE MASTERS DEGREES OFFERED IN BOGOT, WHERE MOST UNIVERSITIES OF COLOMBIA ARE LOCATED. FINDINGS: THE DATA POINT OUT THAT CURRENT MASTERS DEGREE COURSES DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING, WHICH IS IN GREAT DEMAND IN THE WORLD OF WORK: ECONOMICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE NEVER RUN TOGETHER AND RARELY DO UNIVERSITIES COLLABORATE WITHIN A NETWORK TO SET UP JOINT PROGRAMS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE COULD YIELD ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS BY TRAINING STUDENTS FOR A DYNAMIC, GLOBAL AND INCREASINGLY DIGITAL JOB MARKET.

SUCH SOCIETY MEMBERS ARE ALWAYS CONNECTED AND ONLINE, SHARING AND CO-CREATING KNOWLEDGE, AND THEIR LEARNING NEEDS SERVE AS THE BIGGEST DRIVING FORCES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION CURRICULUM CHANGE. OPEN ONLINE LEARNING METHODOLOGY SEEMS TO BE THE BEST-SUITED WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS CHANGE, IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DIGITAL AND NETWORK SOCIETY. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO INVESTIGATE WHY AND WHEN OPEN ONLINE LEARNING IS RELEVANT FOR DIGITAL AND NETWORK SOCIETY AND HOW OPEN ONLINE LEARNING SUPPORTS CURRICULUM CHANGE IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO MEET THE LEARNING NEEDS OF DIGITAL AND NETWORK SOCIETY MEMBERS. THEORETICAL RESEARCH FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED TO: A) DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DIGITAL AND NETWORKED SOCIETY, B) IDENTIFY EMERGING WAYS OF LEARNING OF A DIGITAL AND NETWORKED SOCIETY, AND EXPLAIN WHY OPEN ONLINE LEARNING IS BEST SUITED FOR THEIR NEEDS, C) DISCUSS THE GAP BETWEEN THE NEW WAYS OF LEARNING AND HIGHER EDUCATION CURRICULA AND HOW OPEN ONLINE LEARNING IS RELEVANT FOR ITS CHANGE. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IS BASED ON GLOBAL EXPERTS SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATE THAT OPEN ONLINE LEARNING SHOULD SERVE AS A SOLUTION FOR CURRICULUM CHANGE IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO RESPOND TO DIGITAL AND NETWORK SOCIETY LEARNING NEEDS. HIGHER EDUCATION CURRICULA SHOULD CHANGE TO ENSURE BETTER FLEXIBILITY, RECOGNITION OF NON-FORMAL LEARNING IN FORMAL CURRICULA, BETTER COLLABORATION AND EXCHANGE OF PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL EXPERIENCES.

"INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE ON STUDENTS PERCEPTION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION: EVIDENCE FROM JORDAN COLLABORATIVE LEARNING;  ENJOYMENT;  HIGHER EDUCATION;  SOCIAL MEDIA;  STUDENT PERFORMANCE;  TAM;  USEFULNESS NA AIM/PURPOSE THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE STUDENTS BELIEFS WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL MEDIA USE (SMU) IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH USE ON THE PERCEPTION OF THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE THE MAJOR INFLUENTIAL FACTORS WITH REGARD TO SMU IN STUDENT LEARNING SETTINGS AS A MEANS OF ENHANCING THEIR PERFORMANCE. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, DRAWING ON THE LITERATURE RELATED TO SMU IN HIGHER EDUCATION SETTINGS, A RESEARCH MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. BACKGROUND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE LED TO A SIGNIFICANT TRANSFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THE COMMUNICATION LANDSCAPE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN TERMS OF OFFERING ENHANCED LEARNING AND IMPROVED TEACHING EXPERIENCE. NEVERTHELESS, LITTLE IS KNOWN, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS JORDAN, AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE USE OF SUCH PLATFORMS BY STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION INCREASES THE PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY HAS DEVELOPED A MODEL TO EXAMINE THE PERCEPTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND ITS EFFECT ON THEIR PERFORMANCE. METHODOLOGY THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING APPROACH IS USED TO ANALYZE DATA COLLECTED VIA AN ONLINE SURVEY IN THE FORM OF A QUESTIONNAIRE TO EXAMINE THE USE OF SUCH A MODEL. THE STUDY SAMPLE IS DRAWN FROM UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THREE UNIVERSITIES (ONE PUBLIC AND TWO PRIVATE) IN JORDAN. CONVENIENCE SAMPLING IS USED TO COLLECT DATA. OUT OF 730 SENT QUESTIONNAIRE, 513 RESPONSES WERE RECEIVED, OF WHICH 403 WERE DEEMED QUALIFIED TO BE PART OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS. CONTRIBUTION THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN HIGHER EDUCATION BY ENHANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERCEPTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS ON THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THEIR LEARNING. THE TESTED MODEL CAN BE USED AS A BENCHMARK FOR OTHER STUDIES THAT TARGET THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. FINDINGS THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT PERCEPTIONS OF (1) USEFULNESS, COLLABORATIVE LEARNING, ENHANCED COMMUNICATION, ENJOYMENT, AND EASE OF USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE USE OF SUCH MEDIA IN STUDENT LEARNING; (2) RESOURCE SHARING HAS AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN STUDENT LEARNING, AND (3) SOCIAL MEDIA USE HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND POLICY MAKERS IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WILL HAVE TO TRAIN FACULTY MEMBERS ON EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES AND METHODS IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE SOCIAL MEDIA INTO EDUCATION. THIS WOULD EQUIP FACULTY MEMBERS WITH THE NECESSARY DIGITAL SKILLS NEEDED TO HELP THEM TO BE FULLY INFORMED REGARDING THE BENEFITS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND ITS TOOLS IN LEARNING AND TEACHING ACTIVITIES AND WOULD ALSO ALLOW THEM TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE DRAWBACKS.FURTHERMORE, FACULTY MEMBERS SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR CURRENT TECHNIQUES AND STRATEGIES, AND ADOPT NEW METHODS IN THEIR TEACHING THAT ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AS PART OF THEIR LEARNING. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY CAN REGULARLY POST DISCUSSIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO INCULCATE THE HABIT OF USING SUCH PLATFORMS AMONG STUDENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. STUDENTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS AND POTENTIAL ADVANTAGEOUS ASPECTS OF SMU IN THEIR LEARNING. THIS COULD BE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO INVESTIGATE ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BY STUDENTS AS WELL AS FACULTY MEMBERS. SPECIALLY, AN EMPHASIS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL OBSTACLES THAT MIGHT HINDER THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IMPACT ON SOCIETY SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT ONLY USEFUL FOR SOCIALIZING, BUT ALSO IT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE EDUCATIONAL TOOL THAT ENHANCE STUDENTS PERFORMANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. FUTURE RESEARCH ALTHOUGH THE COLLECTED DATA SUPPORT THE RESEARCH MODEL, THIS STUDY IS SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS LIMITATIONS THAT NEED TO BE TACKLED BY FURTHER STUDIES. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH DESIGN. DATA FOR THIS STUDY WAS COLLECTED VIA SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE STUDIES MAY CONSIDER A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH DESIGN IN ORDER TO UNCOVER ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON THE PART OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS. THIS WOULD ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO GENERATE IN-DEPTH INSIGHTS AND A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF SMU BY HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLING METHOD WAS EMPLOYED TO SELECT RESPONDENTS FOR THIS STUDY. THE RESPONDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY WERE FROM THREE UNIVERSITIES (ONE PUBLIC AND TWO PRIVATE) IN JORDAN.

BACKGROUND THE INEXORABLE GROWTH OF ICT AND THE CONVERGENCE OF NETWORKS HAVE PRODUCED GREAT CHANGES IN HUMAN CULTURE, AND PARTICULARLY IN THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETENCIES AND THE STUDY OF THE TRENDS OF ICT USE TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT BECOME NECESSARY. METHODOLOGY THE STUDY FOLLOWS A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH, WITH A NON-EXPERIMENTAL AND CORRELA-TIONAL DESIGN. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 97 PROFESSORS FROM DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES OF THE ANTIOQUIA REGION (COLOMBIA), AGE BETWEEN 21 AND 60 YEARS OLD, SELECTED IN A NON-ALEATORY WAY, TO FILL IN AN ONLINE SURVEY. CONTRIBUTION A CONTRIBUTION IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZING OF AN ACTIVE POPULATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE TRENDS IN USE OF DIGITAL RESOURCES IN THE CLASSROOM FROM THE PROFESSORS' PERCEPTION THAT ALLOWS RECOGNIZING THE PEDAGOGICAL POTENTIAL OF THESE RESOURCES TO ENRICH THE PROCESS OF SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL APPROPRIATION OF ICT IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (HEI). FINDINGS FINDINGS SHOW THE LEVEL OF USE (LOW AND HIGH) OF ICT (HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES) BY UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS, IDENTIFYING THOSE THAT STILL MAINTAIN A PREDOMINANT USE (E.G., DESKTOP PC); THOSE THAT ARE INNOVATIVE (E.G., LAP-TOP, SMARTPHONE), AND THOSE THAT APPEAR WITH LOW FREQUENCY (E.G., APPS, DIGITAL BLACKBOARD, CLICKERS). THESE RESULTS SHOW SOME FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE DE-VELOPMENT OF THESE TRENDS, SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, HEI SUPPORT, TEACHERS' TRAINING, THE ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES, AND PREFERENCE FOR DIGITAL OPEN RESOURCES. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, UNIVERSITIES SHOULD PROVIDE TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND SUITABLE CONNECTIVITY NECESSARY FOR EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION TO PROFESSORS. BESIDES, IT IS SUGGESTED TO STRENGTHEN THE PEDAGOGICAL USE OF ICT BY TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE TRENDS OF USE AND PROFESSORS' COMPETENCY LEVELS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS THIS STUDY MADE EVIDENT PROFESSORS' GREAT PREFERENCE OF USING STORAGE, DISPLAY, AND SOUND DEVICES, AMONG THEM THE DESKTOP PC AND THE LAPTOP CONTINUE BEING THE KEY TOOLS TO BOOST THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS, IN CONTRAST TO THE LOW USE OF TOOLS TO DETECT PLAGIARISM, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND APPS TO BOOST ACTIVITIES WITH EMERGENT TECHNOLO-GIES.

THE QUESTIONS CONCERNED BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE VOLUME AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTH CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN MASS MEDIA CHANNELS (TELEVISION, RADIO, PRINT MEDIA, INTERNET MEDIA, SOCIAL NETWORKS, MESSENGERS), AND THE REASONS THAT ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO CONSUME A PARTICULAR MEDIA RESOURCE OR, ON THE CONTRARY, NOT TO USE IT. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL NETWORKS OCCUPY A LEADING PLACE IN THE STRUCTURE OF YOUTH MEDIA CONSUMPTION, WHILE TRADITIONAL MEDIA EITHER DO NOT ATTRACT THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION OR ARE CONSUMED ON OCCASION OR IN THE BACKGROUND. THE SMARTPHONE IS THE KEY ACCESS DEVICE TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE; SOCIAL NETWORKS REPRESENT THE DOMINANT TYPE OF MEDIA. AS A RESULT, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MOTIVATION STRUCTURE OF MEDIA CONSUMPTION, IN WHICH THE KEY POSITIONS ARE OCCUPIED BY THE NEEDS DETERMINED BY THE SOCIAL NATURE OF A PERSON-SOCIALIZATION AND SELF-ACTUALIZATION. THE PROCESS OF MEDIA SOCIALIZATION REALIZES AS A HYBRID FORM OF SOCIALIZATION OF THE MODERN PERSON. ON THE ONE HAND, MEDIA SOCIALIZATION IS THE MEDIATION OF SOCIAL NORMS AND VALUES OF THE REAL WORLD; ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS THE CREATION OF NORMS AND VALUES, THE IMMANENT ESSENCE OF WHICH IS POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE MEDIA SPACE. THERE WERE ALSO ENTERTAINMENT, INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND INSTRUMENTATION NEEDS. EACH OF THE NEEDS IS NOT ALWAYS CLOSED, BECAUSE IT TENDS TO GET CLOSER TO OTHER GROUPS. AT THE SAME TIME, MEDIA NEEDS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY RELATED TO INFORMATION REQUESTS OF THE AUDIENCE. TODAY'S MEDIA NOT ONLY BROADCAST INSTITUTIONAL NORMS AND VALUES BUT ALSO FORM AND REPRODUCE NON-INSTITUTIONAL NORMS AND VALUES THROUGH OPINION LEADERS AND AGENTS OF INFLUENCE INTEGRATED INTO THE DIGITAL MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE.

IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY THE IMPACT OF FOLLOWING AN INTRODUCTORY PROGRAMMING COURSE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPUTATIONAL THINKING CAPABILITIES OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, A CONCURRENT COHORT OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN WHICH WE MEASURED BOTH THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE COMPUTATIONAL THINKING CAPABILITIES OF 104 PARTICIPANTS (50 FIRST YEAR STUDENTS ENROLLED ON A BACHELOR'S DEGREE COURSE IN PSYCHOLOGY AT THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF MURCIA (UCAM), AND 54 FIRST YEAR STUDENTS ENROLLED ON A BACHELOR'S DEGREE COURSE IN HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALICANTE (UA)). THE STATISTICAL PROCEDURES APPLIED TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESES WERE A TWO-WAY MIXED ANOVA, A PAIRED-SAMPLE T-TEST AND AN INDEPENDENT-SAMPLE T-TEST. THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE GROUP AT UA HAD AN INITIAL HIGHER SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION OF THEIR COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES THAN THE GROUP AT UCAM. THIS PERCEPTION WAS SUPPORTED BY THEIR OBJECTIVE SCORES, WHICH WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. HOWEVER, THE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITY OF THE UA GROUP DIMINISHED AFTER EXPOSURE TO THE PROGRAMMING COURSE, CONTRASTING WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR OBJECTIVE COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN THE UCAM GROUP, BOTH SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE CAPABILITIES REMAINED CONSTANT OVER TIME. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT COMPUTATIONAL THINKING CAPABILITIES ARE NOT DEVELOPED NATURALLY, BUT NEED TO BE TRAINED. PROVIDING SUCH TRAINING TO ALL OUR STUDENTS, AND NOT ONLY TO THOSE ENROLLED ON UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES IN ENGINEERING, IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO ALLOW THEM TO FACE THE CHALLENGES OF THEIR FUTURE PROFESSIONS.

BASED ON THE STRUCTURAL AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA ON RUSSIA AND CHINA AS THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES OF THE 4TH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION SHIFT THE DEMAND FOR HIGHLY SKILLED LABOUR FORCE. THIS SITUATION LEADS TO THE GAP BETWEEN LABOUR DEMAND AND SUPPLY, AS THE EDUCATION SYSTEMS ARE ORIENTED TO THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE 3RD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. WE CONSIDER CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN THE QUANTITY OF STEM GRADUATES AND RESEARCHERS (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF SPATIAL INEQUALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. FURTHER, ON THE EXAMPLE OF RUSSIA, WE APPLY CORRELATION AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO SHOW THAT THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE SKILL LEVEL OF GRADUATES AND MARKET EXPECTATIONS CONTRIBUTES TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT INEQUALITY. WE DEMONSTRATE THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHARE OF UNEMPLOYED PERSONS AMONG THE ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE POPULATION AND THE SKILLS OF THE LABOUR FORCE FOR ALL FEDERAL DISTRICTS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. ON AVERAGE, AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF EMPLOYEES WITH HIGHER OR SECONDARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BY 1 % DECREASES UNEMPLOYMENT BY 0.32 %.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF STUDENTS' EXPERIENCES WITHIN A RESOURCE-RICH AND DIGITALLY-DRIVEN PEDAGOGICAL SYSTEM IN A SECOND-YEAR ENGINEERING DYNAMICS COURSE. COURSE INSTRUCTORS CREATED AN ACTIVE, BLENDED, AND COLLABORATIVE (ABC) LEARNING ENVIRONMENT PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH MULTIPLE LEARNING RESOURCES. THE RESOURCES INCLUDED A HYBRID LECTUREBOOK (A COMBINATION OF TEXTBOOK AND WORKBOOK), AN ONLINE DISCUSSION FORUM, A LARGE REPOSITORY OF ONLINE VIDEOS, AND A TUTORIAL ROOM STAFFED BY TEACHING ASSISTANTS. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS CHARACTERIZED HOW STUDENTS PERCEIVED THE UTILITY OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMPLEX INTEGRATION OF PEDAGOGIES AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN PERSON AND ACROSS THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT STUDENTS VALUED THE BLENDED STRUCTURE BECAUSE IT PROVIDED THEM WITH BOTH IMMEDIATE AND ASYNCHRONOUS ACCESS TO THE LEARNING RESOURCES. STUDENTS USED THE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM SOLVE HOMEWORK PROBLEMS, STUDY FOR EXAMS, AND IMPROVE THEIR CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN THE COURSE. STUDENTS REPORTED ENGAGING WITH THEIR PEERS TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK CONSTANTLY THROUGHOUT OUT THE COURSE. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT HOW THE LEARNING RESOURCES WERE ALIGNED WITH EACH OTHER AND IN-CLASS PEDAGOGIES, AND THEY WORKED IN TANDEM TO SUPPORT STUDENTS' ACADEMIC SUCCESS.

HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE GOALS OF THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION HAVE UNDERGONE SEVERAL CHANGES: IN HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVE WORLD, THE PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ""UNIVERSAL DIGITAL LITERACY"", WHICH AFFECTED THE CONTENT OF TEACHERS' WORK. THE PECULIARITY OF A TEACHER'S WORK IN THE CONSIDERED PROFESSIONAL AND PEDAGOGICAL ACTIVITY IS THE INTEGRATION OF PEDAGOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND TECHNICALTECHNOLOGICAL COMPONENTS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS INCREASED DEFICIT OF QUALIFIED TECHNO- LOGY TEACHERS. THE MODERN SYSTEM OF TEACHER EDUCATION DOES NOT IMPLY FUNDAMENTAL TECHNICAL TRAINING AND THE TRAINING OF TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE FORMATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL COMPETENCIES.

RESULTS AND SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE AUTHORS SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION GOALS, BASED ON SHARED GENERAL ACTIVITY NATURE. SCIENTIFIC GROUNDS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENGINEERING PEDAGOGY IN TERMS OF TRAINING OF TEACHERS OF TECHNOLOGY ARE IDENTIFIED. THE TRIPLICITY OF SUCH TRAINING IS DEMONSTRATED: THE QUALIFICATION REQUIRED TO BE A TECHNOLOGY TEACHER IMPLIES POSSESSION OF EFFECTIVE EDUCATIONAL METHODS, KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND COMPETENCES IN THE FIELD OF MODERN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT. THE CONSTANTLY GROWING LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE INTENSITY OF THE LATTER AND THE SPECIFIC INTERTWINING OF HUMANITARIAN, NATURAL SCIENCE AND APPLIED COMPONENTS IN THE WORK OF THE TECHNOLOGY TEACHER SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM OF HIS OR HER CONTINUING EDUCATION, RETRAINING AND ADVANCED TRAINING SHOULD BE ORGANISED. ON THE BASIS OF THE TECHNICAL SPECIALTY RECEIVED EARLIER, THE OPPORTUNITIES OF SUCH AN ORGANISATION, INCLUDING TECHNICAL UNIVERSITIES, ARE PRESENTED. ONE EFFECTIVE OPTION COULD BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIGITAL CLUSTER - A PLATFORM, WHICH INTEGRATES THE RESOURCES OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF DIFFERENT STAGES, PRODUCTION STRUCTURES, AS WELL AS ENTERPRISES OF MEDIUM AND SMALL BUSINESS. THE OPERATION OF THIS CLUSTER WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE RAPID SPREAD OF MODERN TECHNOLOGIES AND IT WILL PROVIDE THEIR ACCESSIBILITY AND CONTINUITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOL, AS WELL AS IN SECONDARY VOCATIONAL AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THE COMMON INFORMATION SPACE WILL ENSURE TO PROVIDE THE COORDINATION OF INSTRUMENTAL TRAINING ELEMENTS, TO COMPARE METHODS AND DEVELOP PERSONALITY- ORIENTED APPROACHES WITH THE HELP OF DISTANCE TECHNOLOGIES.

ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN THE INTEGRATION OF ICT IN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS IS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TRAINING IN DIGITAL COMPETENCE (CASTAEDA, ESTEVE & ADELL, 2018). HOWEVER, THE DIDACTIC INTEGRATION (ATTITUDE, TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, AND DIDACTIC USE) OF THESE RESOURCES IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESS IN UNIVERSITY CONTEXTS IS NOT CARRIED OUT IN THE SAME WAY AT ALL EDUCATIONAL DEGREES SINCE, IN PART, IT DEPENDS ON LEGISLATIVE SPECIFICATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF ICT IN TERTIARY EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE DEGREE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SPORTS SCIENCES (CAFYD). THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE: (1) TO STUDY DESCRIPTIVELY THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE BACHELOR OF CAFYD; (2) TO ASSESS IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ICT TOOLS AND THE DIDACTIC USE THEY MAKE OF THEM IN THEIR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; (3) TO ASSESS IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE ACCORDING TO GENDER AND EDUCATIONAL GRADE COURSE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A NON-EXPERIMENTAL QUANTITATIVE SURVEY-BASED DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED, WITH A SAMPLE OF 217 STUDENTS FROM THE BACHELOR IN CAFYD AT THE PONTIFICAL UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA (UPSA). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT STUDENTS GENERAL LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS AVERAGE. SPECIFICALLY, THE DIMENSIONS OF TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND DIDACTIC USE ARE PERCEIVED AT AVERAGE-LOW LEVELS, WHILE STUDENTS ATTITUDES TOWARDS ICT ARE VERY FAVORABLE. REGARDING GENDER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN STUDENTS LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN ANY OF THE COURSES OF THE PROGRAM. THE LEVELS OBTAINED BY CAFYD STUDENTS LEADS TO AN INQUIRY ON WHETHER THESE LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE CURRICULAR DEMANDS POSED BY THE CURRENT SPANISH EDUCATION SYSTEM SUPPORTED BY THE LOMCE OR ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT THE OVERALL POPULATION, WHO HAS NOT RECEIVED SPECIFIC ACADEMIC AND DIGITAL TRAINING, MAY POSSESS.

"VIDEOTAPED TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODOLOGY AN EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND ACTION RESEARCH APPROACH EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY;  FACULTY DEVELOPMENT;  TECHNOLOGY USES IN EDUCATION;  TRAINING;  VIDEO TECHNOLOGY NA PURPOSE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VIDEOTAPED LEARNING WHEN USED IN A UNIVERSITY IN THE UAE, IN TERMS OF EVALUATING THE EXPERIENCES OF THE STUDENTS, ALONG WITH HIGHLIGHTING ITS BENEFITS ALONG WITH CHALLENGES. THE RESEARCH AIMS TO ANALYSE THE CHALLENGES AND BENEFITS OF VIDEOTAPED STORY WORKSHOP METHOD FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE UAE. EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING THEORY CAN BE THE BASIS OF THIS VIDEOTAPED METHOD OF LEARNING AND CAN BE USED FOR FURTHER THEORY AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY TO KNOWLEDGE IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN BUSINESS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE RESULTS GOT BY EXTRACTING PRIMARY DATA (QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE) FROM A SAMPLE SIZE OF 201 STUDENTS. THE PAPER USED AN ACTION RESEARCH METHODOLOGY WITHIN A UNIVERSITY DEGREE COURSE AND WITHIN THE TEACHING PROFESSION. THE RESEARCH DESIGN IS ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURING AND ASSESSING THE CHALLENGES AND BENEFITS OF VIDEOTAPED STORY WORKSHOP METHOD FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, ALONG WITH THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE STUDENTS TOWARDS ITS USE. THE STUDY PRIMARILY USED PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH WHICH IS A COMMUNITY-BASED STUDY, ACTION-BASED ENQUIRY AND ACTION LEARNING. THE APPROACH MOSTLY USED TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES IN A RANGE OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MOST STUDENTS WERE IN FAVOUR OF INCORPORATING VIDEOTAPED STORY WORKSHOP METHOD FOR THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS THIS ERADICATES COMMON LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL BARRIERS. OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THE STUDENTS FOUND IT QUITE CHALLENGING TO LEARN NEW TECHNIQUES OF MAKING VIDEOS BUT LATER ON SHOWN A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF CREATING VIDEOS AND PRESENTING. TECHNOLOGY ALLOWED STUDENTS TO MAKE VIDEOS TO SHOWCASE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES AND STORIES VIA DIGITAL STORYTELLING. SUCH METHODS ENHANCE STUDENTS KNOWLEDGE AND ACADEMIC SKILLS WHILE SUPPORTING LEARNING BEHAVIOUR AND INSPIRES THEM TO PLAN, ORGANISE AND SHARE THEIR IDEAS AND EXPERTISE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE ABOVE METHODOLOGY HAS GOOD POTENTIAL FOR INCLUSIVE LEARNING AND TEACHING AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL WHICH WAS NOT ATTEMPTED DUE TO LACK OF CONNECTING TO THE LEARNERS WITH CHALLENGES AT THE UNIVERSITY AND FOR THE RESEARCHERS ABLE TO CONNECT TO SUCH PEOPLE. THIS METHOD CAN BE EASILY EXTENDED TO INCLUSIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS AS REQUIRED WITH THE DISABILITIES NOTICED FOR THE LEARNERS. HENCE, WHILE MOST STUDENTS DISPLAYED A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS LEARNING FROM CREATING, SHARING AND VIEWING DIGITAL STORIES, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEM WAS NOT ABLE TO BENEFIT ENTIRELY FROM IT DUE TO LACK OF EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS IN GENERATING VIDEOS. THEREFORE, ATTENTION MUST BE EMPHASISED UPON FACTORS TO MINIMISE THESE CHALLENGES IN MULTIPLE WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVISION OF TRAINING TO STUDENTS FOR EASY EMPLOYMENT OF VIDEOTAPING OR AFFORDABLE INTERNET ACCESS, ETC. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE STUDENTS ALSO STATED THAT INITIALLY, THEY PERCEIVED VIDEOTAPE METHODOLOGY QUITE CHALLENGING; HOWEVER, WITH TIME, THEY STARTED ENJOYING THIS METHOD. VIDEOTAPED STORY WORKSHOPS, LEARNERS EASILY GRASP THE IDEA/KNOWLEDGE THROUGH SUBTITLES, EVEN IF THE LESSONS ARE NOT DELIVERED IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE. THIS ASPECT RESULTS IN INCREASING STUDENTS MOTIVATION TOWARDS LEARNING NEW CONCEPTS AND COORDINATING WITH OTHER TEAMS TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND IDEAS. THE METHOD CREATES A STRONG SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT AMONGST STUDENTS THAT SERVES AS A MOTIVATIONAL DRIVER FOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THE VIDEOTAPED STORY WORKSHOP METHOD SUPPORTS STUDENTS LEARNING RATE, INCREASES THEIR INTEREST AND MAKES THE WHOLE LEARNING PROCESS MORE ENJOYABLE. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE WILL IMPROVE AS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS GET COMFORTABLE USING THIS VIDEOTAPE LEARNING METHODOLOGY. THE METHOD WILL BE USEFUL IN REMOTE LEARNING AS IN THE COVID19 SITUATION AND HAS IMMENSE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN EDUCATION. IT CAN EXTEND TO MOST DOMAINS AND KNOWLEDGE, TEACHING SCENARIOS FOR ENGINEERING AND BUSINESS. THE RESEARCH PROMISES TO ADD TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF BLENDED LEARNING AND TO THE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING APPROACH WHICH IS USEFUL TO THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OF EDUCATION AND ITS FUTURE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES VIDEOTAPES STORED IN PLATFORMS, MAKING IT CONVENIENT FOR THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO BROWSE THROUGH AT THEIR CONVENIENCE AND TO IMPROVE ON IN THE FUTURE. THIS VIDEOTAPE METHOD APPLIES TO ANY FIELD OF LEARNING SUCH AS MUSIC, COOKING, ENGINEERING, LANGUAGE STUDY, BUSINESS STUDIES AS IT HAS THE ADVANTAGE TO BE TRANSCRIBED AND ALSO CAPTIONS ADDED FOR THE LEARNERS AND TEACHERS TO UNDERSTAND IT BETTER. IT CAN BE USEFUL IN REMOTE LEARNING SITUATIONS, ALSO LIKE THE CURRENT ONE.

HOWEVER, THE BASIC ASSUMPTION THAT LOW SEP IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CAREGIVER BURDEN HAS SO FAR LACKED EMPIRICAL SUPPORT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN THE CAREGIVER BURDEN AMONG CAREGIVING PARTNERS OF PERSONS WITH A PHYSICAL DISABILITY, I.E., SPINAL CORD INJURY (SCI), APPLYING A DYADIC APPROACH. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE INVESTIGATED 1) THE ASSOCIATION OF THE CAREGIVERS' SEP WITH CAREGIVER BURDEN ('ACTOR EFFECT'); 2) THE ASSOCIATION OF THE CARE-RECEIVERS' SEP WITH CAREGIVER BURDEN ('PARTNER EFFECT'), AND 3) POTENTIAL MEDIATORS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEP AND CAREGIVER BURDEN. METHODS: CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA FROM 118 COUPLES OF PERSONS WITH SCI AND THEIR PARTNERS LIVING IN SWITZERLAND WAS USED. WE FIRSTLY EMPLOYED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO INVESTIGATE THE ACTOR AND PARTNER EFFECTS OF SEP ON OBJECTIVE (HOURS OF CAREGIVING) AND SUBJECTIVE CAREGIVER BURDEN (ZARIT BURDEN INTERVIEW). WE ADDITIONALLY USED STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING TO EXPLORE WHETHER UNFULFILLED SUPPORT NEEDS, PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES AND THE CARE-RECEIVERS HEALTH STATUS MEDIATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEP AND CAREGIVER BURDEN. SEP WAS OPERATIONALIZED BY HOUSEHOLD INCOME, EDUCATION, SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL STRAIN AND HOME OWNERSHIP. RESULTS: WE OBSERVED A CONSISTENT TREND TOWARDS HIGHER OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE BURDEN IN LOWER SEP GROUPS. CAREGIVERS WITH HIGHER SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL POSITON AND HOME OWNERSHIP INDICATED LOWER SUBJECTIVE BURDEN, AND CAREGIVERS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION AND ABSENCE OF FINANCIAL STRAIN REPORTED LOWER OBJECTIVE BURDEN. FURTHER EVIDENCE SUGGESTED A PARTNER EFFECT OF SEP ON CAREGIVER BURDEN, WHEREBY OBJECTIVE CAREGIVER BURDEN WAS REDUCED IN COUPLES WHERE THE CARE-RECEIVER HAD A HIGHER EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEP AND SUBJECTIVE BURDEN WAS PARTIALLY MEDIATED BY THE UNFULFILLED SUPPORT NEEDS AND DEPRIVED PSYCHOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE CAREGIVER, AND THE POOR HEALTH STATUS OF THE CARE-RECEIVER. SIMILAR MEDIATION EFFECTS WERE NOT SUPPORTED FOR OBJECTIVE BURDEN. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY, IN THE CONTEXT OF SCI, PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE CONTEXTUAL ROLE OF SEP IN THE STRESS PROCESS MODEL OF CAREGIVING. TO REDUCE SUBJECTIVE CAREGIVER BURDEN, POLICY PROGRAMS MAY TARGET THE STRENGTHENING OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES, OR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES FOR CAREGIVERS WITH LOW SEP. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S).",2019,SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN THE BURDEN OF CARE: A DYADIC ANALYSIS IN THE CAREGIVING PARTNERS OF PERSONS WITH A PHYSICAL DISABILITY,0

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE DEMOGRAPHIC, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND TREATMENT VARIABLES THAT PREDICT OVERALL AND TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT WITH A PSYCHOSOCIAL, ONLINE INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PSYCHOSIS. METHODS: NINETY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WITH A HISTORY OF PSYCHOSIS WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO A WEB PROGRAM CONTAINING MODULES ON SELF-MANAGEMENT AND RECOVERY, WHICH THEY WERE ASKED TO USE FLEXIBLY AT THEIR OWN PACE. ACTIVITY WAS AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED BY THE SYSTEM. BASELINE MEASURES OF DEMOGRAPHICS, RECOVERY STYLE AND MOTIVATION WERE ADMINISTERED, AND PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE EITHER WEBSITE ACCESS ALONE, OR WEBSITE ACCESS PLUS WEEKLY, ASYNCHRONOUS EMAILS FROM AN ONLINE COACH OVER 12 WEEKS. LOG AND BASELINE ASSESSMENT DATA WERE USED IN NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSIONS TO EXAMINE PREDICTORS OF DEPTH AND BREADTH OF USE OVER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD. A LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF PREDICTOR VARIABLES ON USAGE PROFILES (ACTIVE OR PASSIVE). RESULTS: DEPTH AND BREADTH OF ENGAGEMENT WERE POSITIVELY PREDICTED BY RECEIVING EMAIL SUPPORT, LOW LEVELS OF EXTERNALLY CONTROLLED MOTIVATIONS FOR WEBSITE USE, OLDER AGE, AND HAVING A TERTIARY EDUCATION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN LEVEL OF CONTROLLED MOTIVATION AND CONDITION (+/EMAIL) ON BREADTH AND DEPTH OF ENGAGEMENT: RECEIVING ASYNCHRONOUS EMAILS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ENGAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW, BUT NOT HIGH, LEVELS OF EXTERNALLY CONTROLLED MOTIVATIONS.

THE BADGE WAS DESIGNED AS A SERIES OF CHALLENGES AND AWARDED BASED ON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF BOTH THE CHALLENGES AND AN ASSOCIATED WRITING ASSIGNMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS PAPER CONSIDERS RELEVANT LITERATURE ON THE APPLICATION OF ANDRAGOGY (ADULT LEARNING THEORY) FOR ONLINE LEARNING, A PROPOSED THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITAL BADGE SYSTEMS, THE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES USED FOR THIS PROJECT, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR USING BADGES FOR DELIVERING INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION. THE APPLICATION IS SUPPORTED BY EXAMPLES FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES AND THIS CASE STUDY, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON INFORMATION LITERACY. FINDINGS: ANDRAGOGY IS HIGHLY APPLICABLE TO ONLINE LEARNING BUT IS NOT THE ONLY LEARNING THEORY RELEVANT TO THE DESIGN OF DIGITAL BADGES. MULTIPLE LEARNING THEORIES MAY BE APPLIED DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS USING INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES. DIGITAL BADGES PRESENT ONE MODE OF DELIVERING INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT, BUT THE LEARNING THEORY AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES APPLIED ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DELIVERY MODE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: DRAWING ON BOTH LEARNING THEORY AND INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES, THIS PAPER ADDRESSES WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS AND EDUCATORS CAN DEVELOP DIGITAL BADGES OR BADGE SYSTEMS THAT ALIGN WITH BOTH CURRICULAR NEEDS AND THE CONCEPT-BASED APPROACH OF THE FRAMEWORK. 2019, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2019,SYNTHESIZING A DIGITAL BADGE FOR CHEMISTRY UNDERGRADUATES,0
"DIGITAL TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN SPANISH UNIVERSITIES IN ONLINE MEDIA DISCLOSURE;  INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL;  SOCIAL MEDIA;  SPAIN;  UNIVERSITIES;  WEBSITES NA PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT AND QUALITY OF ONLINE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL (IC) DISCLOSURE RELEASED VIA WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN RELATION TO UNIVERSITY STAKEHOLDERS INFORMATION NEEDS IN SPANISH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. IN ADDITION, THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE ONLINE IC DISCLOSURE ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF UNIVERSITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE STUDY APPLIES CONTENT ANALYSIS AND A SURVEY. THE CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA (TWITTER, FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN AND INSTAGRAM) OF ALL SPANISH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE YEAR 2019, WHEREAS THE SURVEY WAS SUBMITTED TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE SOCIAL COUNCILS OF SPANISH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT UNIVERSITY STAKEHOLDERS ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ONLINE DISCLOSURE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT IC. HOWEVER, THE FINDINGS EMPHASISE THAT SPANISH UNIVERSITIES WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ARE STILL IN THEIR INFANCY. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THE QUALITY OF DISCLOSED INFORMATION ON IC IN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WEBSITES IS OF LOW LEVEL, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE DISCLOSURE OF RELATIONAL CAPITAL. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SPANISH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES VIA SOCIAL MEDIA MAINLY CONCERNS THE STRUCTURAL AND RELATIONAL CAPITAL. LIKEWISE, THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER EVIDENCE THAT THE LARGER AND MORE INTERNATIONALLY FOCUSED UNIVERSITIES REVEAL MORE ONLINE INFORMATION ON IC. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR MANAGERS OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AS A BASIS FOR DEVELOPING ADEQUATE STRATEGIES ADDRESSING IC DISCLOSURE THROUGH THE WEBSITES. IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF UNIVERSITY STAKEHOLDERS, SPANISH UNIVERSITIES CAN BE RECOMMENDED TO FOCUS ON REPORTING HIGHER-QUALITY INFORMATION ON FINANCIAL RELATIONS, STUDENTS SATISFACTION, QUALITY STANDARD, WORK-RELATED KNOWLEDGE/KNOW-HOW AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS FIRMS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.

DESPITE THE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGICAL FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN UNIVERSITIES, THE LEARNING PROCESS SOMETIMES FAILS TO KEEP PACE WITH THEIR ADVANTAGES. UNIVERSITIES ARE INVESTING IN HIGH-TECHNOLOGY CLASSROOMS AND AN EXTENSIVE MULTIDISCIPLINARY SUBSCRIPTION TO E-RESOURCES IN THE BELIEF THAT STUDENTS WILL MAKE USE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, STUDENTS OFTEN IGNORE THE AVAILABILITY OF RELEVANT AND VERIFIED CONTENT AND PREFER TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION FROM GOOGLES SEARCH RESULTS. THE ABSENCE OF STUDENTS INITIAL MOTIVATION TO WORK WITH A COMPLEX PRODUCT IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE FACED BY THE TEACHER-LIBRARIAN. LIMITED TIME AVAILABLE FOR TRAINING (A LECTURE AND A SEMINAR) AND LACK OF PREPAREDNESS AMONG INFORMATION SPECIALISTS AGGRAVATES THE SITUATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE EFFICACY OF NEW EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES TO THE PRESENTATION OF E-RESOURCES WAS EXAMINED IN A PILOT STUDY INVOLVING 940 FIRST-YEAR UNDERGRADUATES AT THE NORTH-WEST INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ACADEMY (RANEPA). THE AUTHORS REPLACED ACADEMIC LECTURES WITH FLEXIBLE AND INTERESTING TECHNIQUES BASED ON STUDENTS INTERESTS, USED ATTENTION TRIGGERS FOR EACH E-RESOURCE IN LECTURE MATERIALS AND FOCUSED THE SEMINAR ON MULTIPLE SPECIFIC SEARCHES TO ATTRACT AND KEEP STUDENTS ENGAGED. NEW EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN FOUR-HOUR SESSIONS FOR FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS IN ALL DISCIPLINES. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE NEW EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES AND TEACHING TECHNIQUES CAN RAISE THE LEVEL OF STUDENTS INVOLVEMENT AND INTEREST IN THE USE OF SUBSCRIBED E-RESOURCES. TO ASSESS THE DEVELOPED APPROACH, THE AUTHORS ANALYZED THE DYNAMICS OF THE STUDENTS VISITS TO SUBSCRIBED RESOURCES AND OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VISITS. THE AUTHORS FOUND SUCH A TREND FOR ALL THE TYPES OF REQUESTS AND RESOURCES. OVERALL, THE NUMBER OF VISITS AND FULL-TEXT REQUESTS INCREASED FROM 88 TO 284 PER CENT FOR THE 2017-2018 ACADEMIC YEAR COMPARED TO THE 2016-2017 ONE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY DEMONSTRATE THE NECESSITY OF APPLYING NEW EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES TO TEACHING STUDENTS WHO LACK THE MOTIVATION TO USE HIGH-QUALITY ELECTRONIC RESOURCES. THE TEACHER-LIBRARIAN CAN BE AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND CONSUMERS. THE NEWLY DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR A WIDE RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING MATERIALS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THE APPROACH COMBINES TEACHING METHODOLOGY WITH RICH INFORMATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCING STUDENTS MOTIVATION TO INFORMATION LITERACY THROUGH MASTERING THEIR DIGITAL SKILLS. STUDENTS INTEREST IN SUBSCRIBED RESOURCES INITIATES THEIR PROFESSIONAL WORK WITH SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. STUDENTS NEED TO CONSTANTLY USE SUBSCRIBED RESOURCES. OTHERWISE, THE SKILLS OF USING INFORMATION E-RESOURCES WILL DISAPPEAR AND MOTIVATION FOR THEIR USE WILL DECREASE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES THAT CAN HELP TO MAINTAIN STUDENTS INTEREST IN INFORMATION E-RESOURCES IS CONTINUING, AND NEW FINDINGS WILL BE PRESENTED IN FUTURE PAPERS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS KNOWLEDGE, NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE USE OF SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AT RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES. IT IS HOPED THAT DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES HELPS STUDENTS WITH LOW DIGITAL LITERACY FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES OR COLLEGES OVERCOME THEIR BIAS AGAINST HIGH TECHNOLOGY. 2019, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2019,USE OF E-RESOURCES BY UNMOTIVATED STUDENTS: A SUCCESS STORY FROM A LIBRARY IN RUSSIA,0

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE EXAMINED WHETHER THIS TREND CHANGES OVER TIME, AND WHAT COULD EXPLAIN IT. WE OFFERED TWO CONTRADICTING HYPOTHESES: THE REGULATIONS HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTS THAT THE GAP BETWEEN PENALTIES FOR ANALOG AND DIGITAL AD CAUSED SINCE IT TAKES TIME FOR ACADEMIC INSTITUTES TO ADJUST THEIR REGULATIONS TO DIGITAL DISHONESTIES. THEREFORE, THIS GAP WILL DIMINISH AND EVENTUALLY DISAPPEAR. THE PERCEPTION HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PENALTY GAP WILL REMAIN STABLE, SINCE IT REFLECTS THE PERCEPTION OF DIGITAL AD AS A WHITE-COLLAR OFFENSE. CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT USED SELF-REPORTED MEASUREMENTS OF AD PERCEPTIONS, THIS STUDY ANALYZED DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE'S PROTOCOLS, WHICH CONTAINS A MORE OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF TYPE OF AD, STUDENT'S EXPLANATIONS, AND PENALTY TYPES. THESE PROTOCOLS PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY, AND NOT ABOUT THEIR OPINIONS. WE ANALYZED THE ENTIRE VOLUME OF 628 UNIVERSITY'S PROTOCOLS COLLECTED DURING FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS. FINDINGS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TREND OF LOWER PENALTIES FOR DIGITAL OFFENSES REMAINED STABLE ACROSS FOUR YEARS. RESULTS SUPPORT THE PERCEPTION HYPOTHESIS, SUGGEST THAT THIS PHENOMENON RELATES TO THE PERCEPTION OF DIGITAL AD AS A WHITE-COLLAR CRIME. LIKE OTHER WHITE-COLLAR CRIMES, IS PERCEIVED AS LESS HARMFUL AND THEREFORE, PUNISHED LESS SEVERELY THAN OTHER CRIMES. THIS CLAIM IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY OUR FINDINGS THAT MOTIVATIONS TO BEHAVE UNETHICALLY, WHICH STUDENTS REPORTED TO THE DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE, INFLUENCED PENALTIES' SEVERITY IN ANALOG, BUT NOT IN DIGITAL SETTINGS. UNEXPECTEDLY, A CONSISTENT GENDER-GAP WAS FOUND IN PENALTIES' SEVERITY FOR BOTH DIGITAL AND ANALOG OFFENSES, INDICATING THAT WOMEN WERE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN MEN. THIS DISSIMILARITY IN PENALIZING AD OFFENSES REMAINED STABLE OVER THE STUDIED PERIOD.

ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN THE INTEGRATION OF ICT IN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS IS TEACHERS' AND STUDENTS' TRAINING IN DIGITAL COMPETENCE (CASTAEDA, ESTEVE & ADELL, 2018). HOWEVER, THE DIDACTIC INTEGRATION (ATTITUDE, TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, AND DIDACTIC USE) OF THESE RESOURCES IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESS IN UNIVERSITY CONTEXTS IS NOT CARRIED OUT IN THE SAME WAY AT ALL EDUCATIONAL DEGREES SINCE, IN PART, IT DEPENDS ON LEGISLATIVE SPECIFICATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF ICT IN TERTIARY EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE DEGREE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SPORTS SCIENCES (CAFYD). THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE: (1) TO STUDY DESCRIPTIVELY THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE BACHELOR OF CAFYD; (2) TO ASSESS IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS' ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ICT TOOLS AND THE DIDACTIC USE THEY MAKE OF THEM IN THEIR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; (3) TO ASSESS IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE ACCORDING TO GENDER AND EDUCATIONAL GRADE COURSE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A NON-EXPERIMENTAL QUANTITATIVE SURVEY-BASED DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED, WITH A SAMPLE OF 217 STUDENTS FROM THE BACHELOR IN CAFYD AT THE PONTIFICAL UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA (UPSA). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT STUDENTS' GENERAL LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS AVERAGE. SPECIFICALLY, THE DIMENSIONS OF TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND DIDACTIC USE ARE PERCEIVED AT AVERAGE-LOW LEVELS, WHILE STUDENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS ICT ARE VERY FAVORABLE. REGARDING GENDER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN STUDENTS' LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN ANY OF THE COURSES OF THE PROGRAM.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS OUR APPROACH ON HOW THE USAGE OF VLES (VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS) CAN BE TRACED AND USED TO ENHANCE THE TEACHING QUALITY SO AS TO IMPROVE ENGAGEMENT. WE FOCUS OUR WORK ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. THE QUESTION IS NOT TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS, FROM THE COLLECTED DATA, WHICH IS ALWAYS CONTROVERSIAL; OR JUST DEFINE A SET OF PRE-ESTABLISHED METRICS, OBTAINED FROM THE DIGITAL DATA CONTAINED INTO THE VLE, AND MONITOR THEM, INDIRECTLY INDUCING AN ASSESSMENT REGIME. THE AIM IS TO LOOK BEYOND THE TRACES LEFT BY STUDENTS AND TO MEASURE THE MOTIVATION OF A STUDENT IN A PARTICULAR TASK, OF A GIVEN SUBJECT, AND IN A SPECIFIC DAY. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE RELY ON THE PSYCHOMETRIC THEORY OF MEASUREMENT TO BUILD A COMPOSITE INDEX OF MOTIVATION AND WE EMBED IT INTO A LEARNING ANALYTICS SYSTEM. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS SYSTEM IS TO PROVIDE TEACHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH OBJECTIVE AND ACCURATE (QUASI) REAL TIME INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENTS MOTIVATION FOR LEARNING, AND HENCE ADEQUATELY ADAPT AND PERSONALIZE THE TEACHING METHODOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES IN CLASSROOMS.

IN FACT, EACH ONE HAS REDESIGNED AND PILOT TESTED AT LEAST ONE RESTRUCTURED LEARNING UNIT FOR ONE OF THEIR COURSES ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED BIG-IDEAS APPROACH; IN ADDITION, MOST ADMIT TO ALREADY HAVING ADJUSTED THEIR TEACHING PRACTICES BY CHANGING THEIR MINDSET REGARDING LEARNING AND HOW TO PROMOTE IT. CONCERNING QUESTION #2: WHAT CHANGES IN KEY CONDITIONS OF LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS HAVE THE STUDENTS PERCEIVED IN COURSES THAT HAVE BEEN REDESIGNED USING A BIG-IDEAS APPROACH? DATA COLLECTED FROM STUDENTS AND PARTICIPATING STAFF MEMBERS, BOTH BEFORE THE REDESIGN AND THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, HAVE PROVIDED TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WITH FEEDBACK CONCERNING PERCEIVED CHANGES IN LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. THIS HAS HAD POSITIVE RESULTS AND PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. CONCERNING QUESTION #3: WHAT LESSONS CAN BE DERIVED FROM REDINGE2S PILOT EXPERIENCES? LESSONS FROM THIS PROJECT ARE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AND THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONAL, PEDAGOGIC, TECHNOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS. A DECALOGUE OF CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS WAS ESTABLISHED, WHICH CONSIDERED THE THINGS THAT MUST GO RIGHT TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH PROPOSED EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY IS A GOOD CASE OF EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN ENGINEERING TEACHING. NO GENERALIZATIONS SHOULD BE MADE, BUT IT SHOWS THAT SIMILAR PROCESSES OF PLANNED CHANGE CAN BE MADE IN TERTIARY SCIENCE, MATH, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY (SMET) EDUCATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE ARE VERY VALUABLE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION DECISION-MAKERS WHO WANT TO INNOVATE BY USING LEARNING ECOLOGIES IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT ILLUMINATE THE INNOVATION PROCESS BECOME VERY USEFUL TO HELP PROVIDE A FOUNDATION TO SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: A NON-CONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO INTEGRATE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHING IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION THIS EXPERIENCE HAS MADE. ITS FOCUS HAS BEEN TO TRANSFORM EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES WITH PEDAGOGICALLY SOUND USES OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES INSTEAD OF JUST INTEGRATING TECHNOLOGIES IN CURRENT SMET TEACHING PRACTICES. FACILITATION-FROM-THE-SIDE AND EMBEDDED CYBERNETIC EVALUATION THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS ARE KEY IDEAS THAT ADD VALUE TO ORGANIC CHANGE PROCESSES. 2019, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2019,REENGINEERING ENGINEERING EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LOS ANDES: THE REDINGE2 PILOT PROJECT,0

IN ADDITION, THE AUTHORS PROVIDE PRACTICAL TIPS ON USING TWITTER FROM THE EXPERIENCE TEACHING IN A TYPICAL HIGHER EDUCATION SETTING: A LARGE, UNDERGRADUATE COURSE IN A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. FINALLY, THE AUTHORS OFFER CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW INSTRUCTORS CAN USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND DIGITAL LITERACY SKILLS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS PAPER PRESENTS A REAL-LIFE CASE STUDY OF USING TWITTER IN AN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT COMMON TO MANY IN HIGHER EDUCATION: A LARGE, UNDERGRADUATE LECTURE CLASS OVER THE COURSE OF ONE SEMESTER. THIS COURSE FOCUSED ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND WAS A REQUIREMENT OF RECEIVING A TEACHING CREDENTIAL AT A LARGE PUBLIC INSTITUTION IN THE MIDWEST. AS A REQUIRED COURSE, STUDENTS FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MAJORS WERE ENROLLED IN THE COURSE, INCLUDING BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, MATHEMATICS, ENGLISH, HISTORY, WORLD LANGUAGES, PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND MANY MORE. WHILE THESE MAJORS WERE GROUPED BY CONTENT-AREA GROUPS (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH; THE HUMANITIES; AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION), FOR THIS PAPER THE AUTHORS WILL FOCUS ON THE PART OF THE COURSE WHERE STUDENTS WERE ALL TOGETHER IN LECTURE FORMAT. GUIDED BY THE RESEARCH ABOVE, AND PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE (GREENHOW AND GLEASON, 2012), IT WAS DECIDED TO USE TWITTER FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEDAGOGICAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING IN-CLASS DISCUSSION, INCREASE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT WITH COURSE MATERIAL, EXPAND STUDENT INTERACTION AND DEVELOP STUDENT PRESENCE. FINDINGS: THE USE OF TWITTER WAS FOUND TO INCREASE STUDENT PARTICIPATION, HELP FACILITATE CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, TO FOSTER STUDENTS SOCIAL PRESENCE, AND TO INCREASE INTERACTIONS WITH REAL WORLD EXPERTS. TWITTER PROVIDED A WAY, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR STUDENTS IN A LARGE LECTURE COURSE TO PARTICIPATE, AND ROUGHLY 90 PER CENT OF STUDENTS DID SO WITH TWITTER.

THE FINDINGS FURTHER INDICATE THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO USING DIGITAL TOOLS TO MOTIVATE, ENGAGE AND FACILITATE STUDENT-BASED EDUCATION, WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO MORE REFLECTION ON TEACHERS OWN TEACHING PRACTICES. BASED ON THE THEORY OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES, THE RESPONDENTS AGREE THAT SHARING IS A BASIC PREREQUISITE FOR A LEARNING ORGANISATION. THEY EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER, THAT SHARING BETWEEN COLLEAGUES IS EASIER IN FORMAL FORUMS THAN AT INFORMAL SETTINGS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT MANY SECTORS INCLUDING THE EDUCATION SECTOR MUST ADAPT TO THE NEW CHANGES IN THEIR TEACHING PRACTICES. NEVERTHELESS, MANY TEACHERS MERELY USE THE BASIC FORM OF DIGITAL LEARNING TOOLS TO DISTRIBUTE THE TEACHING MATERIALS, AS SUCH TOOLS ARE LESS UTILISED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS LEARNING PROCESS (FOSSLAND, 2015). THE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT DIGITAL LEARNING TOOLS HAVE POSITIVE EFFECT ON TEACHING PRACTICES AND THAT THEY CAN FUNCTION AS TOOLS TO IMPROVE THE TEACHERS OWN TEACHING PRACTICES. POSITIVE TEACHING PRACTICES SHOULD ALSO BE SHARED IN A LEARNING ORGANISATION TO IMPROVE TEACHING PRACTICES ON AN ORGANISATIONAL LEVEL. HENCE, SHARING AT A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL CAN IMPACT LEARNING AND THE ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE IN ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. 2019, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2019,TEACHERS USE OF DIGITAL LEARNING TOOL FOR TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION: EXPLORING TEACHING PRACTICE AND SHARING CULTURE,0

STUDENTS WERE INTERVIEWED USING A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE. THE INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYSED USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TWO MAIN THEMES EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSIS. FIRSTLY, THE STUDENTS EXPERIENCED THAT THEY OWN THEIR LEARNING: THE PRESENTATION PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY IN STUDYING AND INCREASED ENGAGEMENT IN THE LEARNING PROCESS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE PROBLEMATIC ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH TEACHING PROGRAMMING BY THE UTILISATION OF A NEW NOVEL TEACHING APPROACH CALLED GAMES-BASED CONSTRUCTION LEARNING (GBCL) TO ATTEMPT TO INCREASE MOTIVATION, ENGAGEMENT AND LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS. AN INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL TREND IS TO INTRODUCE CODING AT EARLIER EDUCATION LEVELS RESULTING IN UPPER PRIMARY EDUCATION (PE) BEING THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER TO ASCERTAIN IF GBCL USING SCRATCH TO TEACH PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS IS MORE EFFECTIVE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UPPER PE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A LARGE-SCALE EMPIRICAL STUDY INTRODUCING GBCL TO TEACH PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS INTO 16 CLASSES BETWEEN LEVELS 4 AND 7 IN PE UTILISING 384 CHILDREN. A DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK FOR GBCL USING SCRATCH IN PE WAS UTILISED TO ADDRESS ALL INCORPORATION ISSUES AND THE GAMES CONSTRUCTED BY THE CHILDREN SCORED UTILISING A GAME CODIFICATION SCHEME SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS PROGRAMMING AND DESIGN AS A QUANTIFICATION RUBRIC. THE EXPERIMENT UTILISED EIGHT 1- H LESSONS ON GBCL USING SCRATCH. FINDINGS: THE RESULTED IN 178 GAMES OF VARYING LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY DEVELOPED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT GBCL WAS AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO TEACH PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS USING SCRATCH AT ALL LEVELS OF UPPER PE. PRIMARY SEVEN STUDENTS SCORED HIGHER IN RELATION TO THE DESIGN METRIC OF THE QUANTIFICATION CODIFICATION RUBRIC. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: UNDER THE CURRICULUM FOR EXCELLENCE (CFE) IN SCOTLAND NON-TRADITIONAL TEACHING APPROACHES ARE ENCOURAGED AND DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL LITERACY SKILL IS HIGHLY ADVOCATED. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A NEW APPROACH, NOVEL APPROACH CALLED GBCL WHERE CHILDREN CREATE THEIR OWN GAMES UTILISING AN ENGINE SUCH AS SCRATCH IS GAINING SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION IN TERMS OF BEING A NOVEL APPROACH. DESPITE A PLETHORA OF SIMILAR STUDIES ASSOCIATED WITH GBCL, IT IS STILL NOT AS DEVELOPED AS GAMES-BASED LEARNING AND REQUIRES FURTHER EMPIRICAL STUDIES TO SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE APPROACH AND RESOLVE IDENTIFIED ISSUES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ITSELF CAN LEAD TO A HIGHLY REWARDING CAREER IN A NUMBER OF SECTORS FROM GAMES DEVELOPMENT TO BANKING, SUCH AS CYBERSECURITY AND SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT. IN THE LAST DECADE, IN PARTICULAR DUE TO THE UBIQUITOUS NATURE OF TECHNOLOGY THERE IS AN INCREASING INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL TREND ASSOCIATED WITH TEACHING RUDIMENTARY PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS AT A FAR YOUNGER AGE INCLUDING SECONDARY EDUCATION AND THE UPPER PE LEVEL.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE FACTORS INFLUENCING OLDER ADULTS WILLINGNESS TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL AND HEALTH INFORMATION WHEN USING HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES SUCH AS WEARABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND RELEVANT SERVICES, WITH A FOCUS ON INFORMATION TYPE AND REQUESTING ENTITY. METHODS: DATA CAME FROM A SURVEY ON OLDER ADULTS AT LOCAL SENIOR CENTERS IN SOUTH KOREA (N = 170; MEAN AGE = 77; 45.9% WOMEN). QUESTIONS ASKED PARTICIPANTS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIOECONOMIC, HEALTH STATUS, AND MEDICAL SERVICE INFORMATION WITH SIX ENTITIES: FAMILY, HOSPITAL, RESEARCHER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY, DEVICE DEVELOPER/CORPORATION, AND INSURANCE COMPANY. A SERIES OF LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS WERE ESTIMATED TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, SELF-RATED HEALTH, AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY WITH THE WILLINGNESS TO SHARE BY INFORMATION TYPE AND REQUESTING ENTITY. RESULTS: HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF OLDER ADULTS REPORTED BEING WILLING TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION WITH FAMILY AND HOSPITALS THAN WITH RESEARCHERS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, DEVICE DEVELOPER/CORPORATIONS, OR INSURANCE COMPANIES (80.4%, 66.1% VS. 39.9%, 23.5%, 25.2%, 19.0%, RESPECTIVELY). EDUCATION AND AGE WERE THE MOST COMMON FACTORS AFFECTING OLDER ADULTS WILLINGNESS TO SHARE ACROSS INFORMATION TYPES AND REQUESTING ENTITIES. HIGHER EDUCATION CONSISTENTLY SHOWED A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE WILLINGNESS TO SHARE; HOWEVER, OLDER AGE SHOWED A POSITIVE EFFECT. OLDER ADULTS WITH POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY WERE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION WITH DEVICE DEVELOPER/CORPORATIONS. WOMEN WERE LESS LIKELY TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAN MEN. OLDER ADULTS WITH POORER SELF-RATED HEALTH WERE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION, IN PARTICULAR MEDICAL SERVICE INFORMATION, WITH HOSPITALS. CONCLUSIONS: OLDER ADULTS ARE SELECTIVE ABOUT SHARING THEIR PERSONAL AND HEALTH INFORMATION WHEN USING HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES AND RELEVANT SERVICES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND PROMOTE HEALTH, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF INFORMATION AND THE ENTITIES ASKED TO SHARE WITH. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INFORMATION GRANULARITY AND EMPOWERING OLDER ADULTS WITH CONTROL OVER SHARING EACH TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT IN THE PRACTICE OF HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES AMONG OLDER ADULTS FOR THE NEXT DECADES.

"THE ECOSYSTEM OF E-LEARNING MODEL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT;  DIGITAL HABITAT;  LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES;  PHYSICS EDUCATION;  SAKAI ACADEMIC RESEARCH;  HIGHER EDUCATION;  LEARNING;  MODEL;  STUDENT;  TEACHING;  UNIVERSITY SECTOR; SOUTH AFRICA;  WESTERN CAPE WE PRESENT THE ECOSYSTEM OF E-LEARNING (EEL) MODEL, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT, AND WHICH TAKES FULL ACCOUNT OF ALL INHABITANTS AND THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS, NOT ONLY THE COMPONENTS, OF THE E-LEARNING FOOD CHAIN. SPECIFICALLY, THIS MODEL WAS APPLIED TO OUR CONTEXT WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WESTERN CAPE, HIGHLIGHTING THE ROLE OF THE ACADEMIC DEVELOPER WITHIN THE MODEL. A KEY ARGUMENT ADVANCED IN THIS PAPER IS THAT ACADEMIC DEVELOPERS SHOULD WORK TO REDUCE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH EMERGING E-TOOLS. THE EEL MODEL IS USED TO EMPHASISE THE ROLE OF ACADEMIC DEVELOPERS AS MEDIATORS BETWEEN COMPONENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS. SIGNIFICANCE: BY THE APPLICATION OF THE EEL MODEL, IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE USE OF E-TOOLS AND THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH PEDAGOGIES WITHIN ANY CONTEXT MUST BE SENSITIVE TO THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM, WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS SIMULTANEOUSLY A TOP-DOWN AND A BOTTOM-UP PROCESS. THE STUDENT MUST BE THE CORE FOCUS IN THE ADOPTION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THE LEARNING PROCESS, BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY THE STUDENT CAN ONLY BE IN FOCUS WHEN THEY ARE PLACED WITHIN THEIR BROADER ECOSYSTEM INCLUDING THE SOCIETAL LEVEL. OUR FINDINGS ADD TO THE DEBATE ON PHYSICS EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY, AND MORE BROADLY BY PROVIDING NEW WAYS OF CONCEPTUALISING AN E-LEARNING ECOSYSTEM. IT IS ADVOCATED THAT AN ACADEMIC DEVELOPER-MEDIATOR SHOULD STEP IN TO MEDIATE BETWEEN ACADEMICS, TUTORS AND EMERGING E-TOOLS, THROUGH A STRUCTURED DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS FOR LEARNING AND TEACHING.

SUCH METHODS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH REPLACE SLOW SCHOLARSHIP AND/OR PEOPLE WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES RUN THE RISK OF REINFORCING NEOLIBERAL LEARNING SPACES AND PERPETUATING PROCESSES OF DEEP COLONIZATION (ROSE, 1996). WE ARGUE THAT THESE NEW LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS MUST BE GROUNDED IN CRITICAL PEDAGOGIES TO AVOID EXTENDING NEOLIBERAL AGENDAS IN THE UNIVERSITY CONTEXT. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE THESE METHODS REQUIRE CAREFUL STUDENT AND TEACHER REFLECTION, COUPLED WITH CONSCIENTIOUS ATTEMPTS AT DECOLONISING EXISTING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PEDAGOGIES (RADCLIFFE, 2017). IN THIS ARTICLE WE EXPLORE THE INTERSECTIONS AND DISCONNECTIONS BETWEEN CRITICAL PEDAGOGY, ATTEMPTS AT DECOLONISING THE CLASSROOM, AND FLEXIBLE LEARNING APPROACHES LIKE BLENDED LEARNING. WE DRAW ON OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES AS BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE CONTINUOUSLY LEARNING LEARNING-TEACHERS AND LEARNING-STUDENTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A HIGHER LEVEL SUBJECT ENTITLED RETHINKING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS TAUGHT AT BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE LEVELS AT MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA. A BLENDED LEARNING APPROACH IS PRACTICED BY THE LEARNING-TEACHERS OF THIS COURSE, IN AN EFFORT TO SITUATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND SHIFT THEIR PEDAGOGY TOWARDS DECOLONIZING APPROACHES. IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN LEARNING-TEACHERS AND LEARNING-STUDENTS, WE ARGUE THAT WHILE BLENDED LEARNING CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND SUPPORT DECOLONISING PEDAGOGIES, CONSTRAINTS THAT ARISE FROM A NEOLIBERAL UNIVERSITY CONTEXT, SUCH AS THE REFRAMING OF STUDENTS AS CLIENTS AND THE PRIORITISATION OF MONEY-SAVING APPROACHES, CAN MODERATE SUCH PROMISE. FURTHER, DECOLONISING EDUCATION REQUIRES MORE THAN WHAT CAN BE DELIVERED BY BLENDED LEARNING APPROACHES IN ISOLATION. THEY ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY REQUIRE A CAREFUL RECONFIGURATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES IN A RELATIONAL AND MULTIDIRECTIONAL MANNER, OF LEARNING-TEACHERS, LEARNING-STUDENTS AND THE BROADER LEARNING-INSTITUTION CONTEXT. SO WHILE THE LEARNING-TEACHERS EFFORTS AT DECOLONISING THE CLASSROOM AND BETTER ENGAGING WITH LEARNING-STUDENTS REMAIN PARTIAL, THEY ARE DEEPLY VALUED BY MANY LEARNING-STUDENTS AND ARE IMPORTANT TENTATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS NURTURING MORE CARE-FULL DECOLONISING LEARNING SPACES.

BUT BASED ON THE EXISTING DEMAND GAP, UNIVERSITIES ARE EAGER TO FIRST KNOW WHICH SKILLS THE IT-RELATED INDUSTRIES EXPECT FROM NEW DIGITAL WORKERS. THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED IN THAILAND, EXPLORES THE COMPETENCY OF THE DIGITAL WORKFORCE, AN ISSUE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED AS VITAL TO THE 20172021 NATIONAL AGENDA. THE RESEARCH PROJECT WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO STEPS. PHASE ONE WAS TO STUDY AND IDENTIFY ESSENTIAL COMPETENCIES FOR THE DIGITAL WORKFORCE BY FIRST REVIEWING THE LITERATURE, THEN VERIFYING THESE RESULTS THROUGH QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGY. THIRTY IT EXPERTS IN IT AND RELATED INDUSTRIES WERE INVITED TO INTERVIEW SESSIONS. EVENTUALLY, AFTER CONTENT ANALYSIS, 24 COMPETENCIES WERE PRESENTED. PHASE TWO WAS TO SURVEY THE COMPETENCY EXPECTATIONS OF IT EXPERTS BY USING THE INITIAL QUESTIONS GENERATED BY PHASE ONE'S OUTCOME. 260 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ANALYZED. EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA) WAS SELECTED TO CLUSTER THE DIGITAL WORKFORCE COMPETENCIES THAT WERE FOUND. THREE SIGNIFICANT CATEGORIES WERE SELECTED BASED ON EIGENVALUE, AND THE AVERAGE RESULTS OF DEMAND WERE EXPLAINED. INDUSTRIES HAD MOST EXPECTED COMPETENCIES IN THE PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND IT KNOWLEDGE CATEGORY, FOLLOWED BY THE IT TECHNICAL CATEGORY AND IT MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT CATEGORY. THE TOP FIVE COMPETENCIES DESIRED WERE LIFELONG LEARNING, PERSONAL ATTITUDE, TEAMWORK, DEPENDABILITY, AND IT FOUNDATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE WERE SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN THE IT INDUSTRY AND IT IN NON-IT INDUSTRIES. THE RESULTS PRESENTED A NEW PERSPECTIVE THAT IS VERY USEFUL TO THAILAND.

PEOPLE WITH DIABETES NEED FREQUENT MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP OF HEALTH PARAMETERS, AND EHEALTH SERVICES CAN BE HIGHLY VALUABLE. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE USE OF EHEALTH IN DIFFERENT SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS AMONG PEOPLE WITH DIABETES. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF 4 DIFFERENT EHEALTH PLATFORMS (APPS, SEARCH ENGINES, VIDEO SERVICES, AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES) AND THE ASSOCIATION WITH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (SES) AMONG PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T1D AND T2D, RESPECTIVELY). METHODS: WE USED EMAIL SURVEY DATA FROM 1250 MEMBERS OF THE NORWEGIAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION (AGED 18-89 YEARS), COLLECTED IN 2018. ELIGIBLE FOR ANALYSES WERE THE 1063 RESPONDENTS HAVING T1D (N=523) AND T2D (N=545). 5 RESPONDENTS REPORTED HAVING BOTH DIABETES TYPES AND THUS ENTERED INTO BOTH GROUPS. USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, WE ESTIMATED THE USE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EHEALTH. BY LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS, WE STUDIED THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE USE OF THESE TYPES OF EHEALTH AND SES (EDUCATION AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME), ADJUSTED FOR GENDER, AGE, AND SELF-RATED HEALTH. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT 87.0% (447/514) OF PEOPLE WITH T1D AND 77.7% (421/542) OF PEOPLE WITH T2D HAD USED 1 OR MORE FORMS OF EHEALTH SOMETIMES OR OFTEN DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE USING SEARCH ENGINES WAS THE LARGEST IN BOTH DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS, FOLLOWED BY APPS, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND VIDEO SERVICES. WE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A HIGH LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND THE USE OF SEARCH ENGINES, WHEREAS THERE WERE NO EDUCATIONAL DIFFERENCES FOR THE USE OF APPS, SOCIAL MEDIA, OR VIDEO SERVICES. IN BOTH DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS, HIGH INCOME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF APPS. IN PEOPLE WITH T1D, LOWER INCOME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF VIDEO SERVICES.

THE CURRENT PRACTICE FOR VISUALIZING BEHAVIOUR WITHIN A DIGITAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IS TO GENERATE PLOTS BASED ON HAND-ENGINEERED OR CODED FEATURES USING DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE. WHILE THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN RELATING BEHAVIOUR TO KNOWN PHENOMENA, FEATURES CRAFTED FROM DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE ARE NOT LIKELY WELL SUITED TO MAKING UNFAMILIAR PHENOMENA SALIENT AND THUS CAN PRECLUDE DISCOVERY. WE INTRODUCE A METHODOLOGY FOR ORGANICALLY SURFACING BEHAVIOURAL REGULARITIES FROM CLICKSTREAM DATA, CONDUCTING AN EXPERT IN-THE-LOOP HYPERPARAMETER SEARCH, AND IDENTIFYING ANTICIPATED AS WELL AS NEWLY DISCOVERED PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR. WHILE THESE VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED BEFORE IN THE BROADER MACHINE-LEARNING COMMUNITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND NEURAL NETWORKS AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WORD VECTORS, WE APPLY THEM TO ONLINE BEHAVIOURAL LEARNER DATA AND GO A STEP FURTHER, EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL ON PRODUCING TANGIBLE, NON-TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS OF BEHAVIOUR THAT SUGGEST PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENT TO THE COURSE DESIGNERS AND INSTRUCTORS.

A MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO ENCOURAGE THESE TO USE DIGITAL MEDIA MORE ACTIVELY AND HENCE, ALSO TO BECOME ROLE MODELS FOR THEIR OWN STUDENTS FUTURE DIGITAL PRACTICE. HOWEVER, RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT A MAIN CONCERN WITH MOOC PROGRAMS IS ATTRITION. IN LINE WITH THOSE FINDINGS, AND ACCORDING TO THE COURSE PLATFORM DATA, NONE OF THE MOOC PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE COURSE MATERIAL. AS THE COURSE PROGRESSED, LESS AND LESS PAGES WERE OPENED AND OBLIGATORY ASSIGNMENTS WERE ONLY RARELY SUBMITTED. THE PARTICIPANTS MAY THUS BE DESCRIBED AS DROPOUTS. FIVE OF THESE PARTICIPANTS WERE THEN INTERVIEWED ABOUT THEIR MOOC EXPERIENCES AND ACTIVITIES. THE INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYZED ACCORDING TO GROUNDED THEORY PROCEDURES. A GENERAL FINDING WAS THAT THE INFORMANTS WOULD IN FACT PUT SOME OF THE MATERIAL AND IDEAS FROM THE MOOC TO USE. EVEN IF THEY DROPPED OUT, THIS INDICATES A GAIN FROM THE COURSE. IN FACT, SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT WAS INTRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THESE INFORMANTS DIGITAL PRACTICES WHEN THEY TESTED OUT NEW IDEAS IN THEIR OWN TEACHING. FRAME-FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF FINANCIAL COMPENSATION OR A NONSTOP FLOW OF COMPETING TASKS, HOWEVER, LED THE INFORMANTS TO DOWN-PRIORITIZE THE FORMAL DEMANDS IN THE MOOC PILOT.

FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (HE), INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 4.0 HAS THE FOLLOWING PREDICTABLE IMPACTS: THE DEMAND OF THE LABOR MARKET HAS CHANGED, MANY ECONOMISTS EVEN HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THIS REVOLUTION COULD POSE A RISK OF BREAKING THE LABOR MARKET. WHEN AUTOMATIONREPLACES PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE ECONOMY, WORKERS, ESPECIALLY LOW AND MEDIUM SKILLED WORKERS, WILL BE REDUNDANT IF THEY DO NOT ADAPT QUICKLY TO PRODUCTION CHANGES. THIS CREATES A DIFFERENTIATION OF THE LABOR MARKET, DIVING IT INTO TWO GROUPS: ONE FLOW-SKILLED LABOR WITH LOW-PAID WAGES AND THE OTHER OF HIGH-SKILLED LABOUR WITH HIGH-PAID WAGES [1]. HIGHER EDUCATION MUST MEET AN INCREASING DEMAND FOR HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE LABOUR TO CREATE A LARGE SURPLUS VALUE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT THE LABOR MARKET WILL NEED IN THE NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES SO QUICKLY. TRAINING AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS FACE NEW REFORM AND COMPETITION REQUIREMENTS. MANY TECHNOLOGY CORPORATIONS WITH GREAT TECHNOLOGICAL, HUMAN AND FINANCIAL POTENTIAL WILL HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES IN TURNING KNOWLEDGE INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THAT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS DO NOT HAVE [2]. THIS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE BOUNDARIES AND DISTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE AND CREATIVE ABILITY BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY. NOTABLY, THE RAPID CHANGE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 4.0 REQUIRES HIGHER EDUCATION TO EQUIP LEARNERS WITH BASIC SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE, CREATIVE THINKING, THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CHALLENGES AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING WORK DEMANDS TO AVOID THE RISK OF BEING SACKED [3]. THE BOUNDARY AMONG TRADITIONAL TRAINING DISCIPLINES IS INCREASINGLY FUZZY, THE TREND OF CROSS- AND INTER-DISCIPLINARY TRAINING ASSOCIATED WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME POPULAR. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 4.0 DIFFERS FROM PREVIOUS INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS IN THAT THERE IS A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES, BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL, DIGITAL, AND BIOLOGICAL SPHERES [4]. THIS REQUIRES HIGHER EDUCATION TO PROVIDE LEARNERS WITH POPULAR KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AND CREATIVE THINKING, SYSTEM THINKING SO THAT LEARNERS CAN LEARN BY THEMSELVES ANDBE ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHALLENGES AND INTERDISCIPLINARY AND CHANGING JOB REQUIREMENTS. THE NEW LEARNING SPACE ON THE INTERNET IS FORMED AND THE COMBINATION OF TRADITIONAL EDUCATION AND MOOC (MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSE) BECOMES AN INEVITABLE TREND.

HOWEVER, FACE-TO-FACE TEACHING STILL PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE OF ITS GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FORMING SKILLS, ESPECIALLY SOFT SKILLS (EMPLOYMENT SKILLS) FOR LEARNERS. THEREFORE, A HARMONIOUS COMBINATION OF EDUCATION IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY AND MOOC WILL BE THE INEVITABLE TREND TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GLOBAL LABOR MARKET.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UKOU IN 1969 MARKED A NEW ERA IN DISTANCE HIGHER EDUCATION. IT GAVE DISTANCE EDUCATION A NEW LEGITIMACY AND OPENED UP NEW PROSPECTS FOR POPULATIONS THAT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WERE UNABLE TO ATTEND A CAMPUS-BASED UNIVERSITY. MANY OF THE NEW OPEN UNIVERSITIES WERE HERALDED AS A CONSPICUOUS DEVELOPMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION, WITH INNOVATIVE FEATURES SUCH AS: OPEN ACCESS, REACHING OUT TO PART-TIME ADULT STUDENTS, PROVIDING ACADEMIC FACULTY THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN TEAMS TO PREPARE STUDY MATERIALS, MODULAR CREDIT ACCUMULATION, TEACHING HUGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS, AND HARNESSING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES INTO THEIR TEACHING/LEARNING PROCESSES. IN THE LAST THREE DECADES, MANY OF THESE INNOVATIVE CHARACTERISTICS PIONEERED BY OPEN UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY CAMPUS UNIVERSITIES. THIS HAS ERODED THE UNIQUE STATUS OF OPEN UNIVERSITIES IN MANY NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE EMERGENCE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAS CHALLENGED THE UNDERLYING PREMISES OF THE INDUSTRIAL MODEL OF MANY OPEN UNIVERSITIES, AS WELL AS THEIR LOGISTIC OPERATION.

"TAM AND STAGES OF ADOPTION OF BLENDED LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION BY APPLICATION OF DATA MINING TECHNIQUES NA DECISION TREES;  TREES (MATHEMATICS); CONTEXTUAL VARIABLES;  DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS;  OPERATIONAL DEFINITION;  PREDICTIVE MODELING;  PROFESSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS;  SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES;  TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL;  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK; DATA MINING THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYSE AND IDENTIFY THE STAGES OF ADOPTION OF THE BLENDED LEARNING (BL OR B-LEARNING) METHODOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXTS, AND TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE STAGES WITH A SET OF VARIABLES RELATED TO PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, ATTRIBUTES PERCEIVED ON BL AND CONTEXTUAL VARIABLES. ABOUT 980 ACTIVE ACADEMIC STAFF FROM 43 SPANISH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES PARTICIPATED. THE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (TAM) WAS USED AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF THE VARIABLES. THROUGH THE USE OF DATA MINING TECHNIQUES (CLUSTERING AND DECISION TREES), GROUPINGS WERE MADE BASED ON THE B-LEARNING ADOPTION STAGE AND A SUBSEQUENT PREDICTIVE MODEL OF THESE STAGES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE INTENTION TO USE BL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR VARIABLE IN ALL MODELS APPLIED. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGHER FREQUENCY OF USE AND EXPERIENCE IN DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS WITH HIGHER STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BL METHODOLOGY WAS VERIFIED. REGARDING THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THEY EXERT EFFECTS THAT ARE MARGINAL IN ALL CASES. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC MANY UNIVERSITIES AND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE DESIGNING STRATEGIC PLANS AND DIVERSE ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT AND SPREADTHE USE OF BL METHODOLOGIES. TAM HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO STUDY THE BEHAVIOUR AND THE INTENTION OF USING A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CLASSROOM. THE STUDY OF BL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TAM HAS GENERALLY BEEN CARRIED OUT USING INFERENTIAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE BL METHODOLOGY FROM THE TAM APPROACH. GROUPS OF ADOPTING TEACHERS CAN BE ANALYSED USING THE TAM APPROACH ACCORDING TO THE STAGE OF USE OF THIS INNOVATION. IN CONTRAST TO TRADITIONAL INFERENTIAL TECHNIQUES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURE BASED ON DECISION TREES, WHICH FACILITATES A MORE REFINED ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE SET OF TAM PREDICTOR VARIABLES (PU, PEOU, BI, ETC.) AND THE CRITERION VARIABLE (STAGES OF ADOPTION). THE OBTAINING OF MORE COMPLETE AND ADJUSTED TREES LEADS TO BETTER PREDICTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONCRETE ACTIONS THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AS PROTECTIVE OR MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR THE DIFFUSIONOF THE BL METHODOLOGY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY INTEREST IN FOCUSING ATTENTION ON A COMPLEX SYSTEM SUCH AS THE ONE REPRESENTED BY THE BL METHODOLOGY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MODELS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ACCEPTANCE REINFORCES AN INTERESTING LINE OF RESEARCH THAT CAN ENRICH THE APPROACH AND SCOPE OF THE TAM THEORY AND GENERATES KNOWLEDGE THAT HELPS PROMOTE STRATEGIC ACTIONS TO OPTIMISE THE INSTITUTIONAL DIFFUSIONOF THE BL TRAINING MODALITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXTS. 2019 BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION",2019,TAM AND STAGES OF ADOPTION OF BLENDED LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION BY APPLICATION OF DATA MINING TECHNIQUES,0

HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERSHIP IS OF INTEREST. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH, UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF THIS NEED FOR EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP AS THEY FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES WITH ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION AND THE EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP IS IMPORTANT TO THE NORMAL FUNCTION AND SUCCESS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AMONG THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS RECOGNIZED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE, AS IT FOCUSES ON THE DIVISION OF LEADERSHIP AMONG ACADEMIC MEMBERS WHO HAVE ENOUGH ABILITIES TO MANAGE COLLECTIVELY THE RANGE OF LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES REQUIRED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP ACADEMICS CAN MANAGE THE UNIVERSITY EFFECTIVELY, LEADING THE ORGANIZATION TO MAXIMIZE ORGANIZATIONAL RESULTS.

METHODOLOGY A SUITE OF NINE INTERACTIVE E-TUTORIALS, ADDRESSING ESSENTIAL DIGITAL LITERACY SKILLS FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH INSTRUCTOR AND STUDENT PEER COLLABORATION USING ARTICULATE SOFTWARE, INFORMED BY BEST PRACTICE. THE E-TUTORIALS WERE EMBEDDED IN THE INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THREE UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE COURSES, IN WHICH DIGITAL LITERACY FORMED THE CORE LEARNING CONTENT, TO COMPLEMENT CLASSROOM-BASED LEARNING. STUDENTS IN THESE COURSES WERE SURVEYED VIA SURVEYMONKEY ABOUT THEIR SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE OF USING THE E-TUTORIALS, AS WELL AS THEIR GENERAL PERCEPTIONS OF DIGITAL LITERACY AND ONLINE LEARNING. EIGHTY-SIX STUDENTS IN TOTAL COMPLETED THE QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH CONSISTED OF TWENTY-THREE CLOSED- AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS.

FINDINGS THE E-TUTORIALS WERE PERCEIVED AS VALUABLE IN REINFORCING CLASSROOM LEARN-ING, ALLOWING RESPONDENTS TO REVISE CONCEPTS AND MATERIALS COVERED IN FACE-TO-FACE CLASSES, AT THEIR OWN PACE AND IN THEIR OWN TIME. SURVEY RESPONSES SHOWED THAT THE ACCESSIBILITY, EASE-OF-USE, DESIGN AND DURATION OF THE E-TUTORIALS WERE DEEMED EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF USER ENGAGEMENT; HOWEVER, SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES WERE IDENTIFIED, SUCH AS BROWSER INCOMPAT-IBILITY, UNEVEN SOUND QUALITY AND GENERAL INTERNET CONNECTION ISSUES, WHICH DISRUPTED THEIR LEARNING.

THE EXPERIENCE INTRODUCES DIGITAL MAKING AS AN ACTIVITY IN WHICH STUDENTS CREATE AN OBJECT USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. IN THE PROCESS, THEY NOT ONLY GAIN AN INSIGHT INTO HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS, BUT ALSO LEARN THE CONTENT AND COMPETENCES OF THE CURRICULUM. THIS INNOVATIVE TEACHING PRACTICE WAS CARRIED OUT AS ACTION RESEARCH IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADITIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION PRACTICES. IN THIS SENSE, THE PROPOSAL PUTS THE STUDENT AT THE CENTRE OF THE PROCESS AS THE AUTHOR AND PROTAGONIST OF THEIR OWN LEARNING PROCESS. THE EXPERIENCE IS BASED ON THEIR OWN INTERESTS: THEY DECIDE WHAT TO MAKE BASED ON A GIVEN CONTEXT. THE STUDENTS WORK IN GROUPS AND LOOK FOR WHAT THEY NEED TO LEARN TO OVERCOME A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE, WHILE THE TEACHER SUPPORTS THE PROCESS AS A FACILITATOR, OFFERING GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES WHEN NECESSARY. THE EVALUATION OF THE WHOLE PROCESS IS REGULATED VIA A GROUP DIARY (A SHARED ONLINE DOCUMENT) AND AN INDIVIDUAL DIARY (A BLOG) THAT THE STUDENTS PRODUCE. THE FINAL EVALUATION IS NOT ONLY OF THE PRINTED PRODUCT; THE STUDENTS ALSO PRODUCE A VIDEO IN THE FORM OF STORYTELLING, IN WHICH THEY EXPLAIN HOW THE PROCESS EVOLVED FROM THE INITIAL IDEA TO THE FINAL IMPRESSION OF THE OBJECT. THEY ALSO REFLECT ON WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED, HOW TEAMWORK HAS WORKED AND WHAT POSSIBILITIES THEY BELIEVE DIGITAL MAKING OFFERS IN THE PRIMARY AND NON-FORMAL EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH THEY WILL WORK. ALL OF THE PROCESSES ARE COMPILED IN THE STUDENTS BLOGS, AS WELL AS IN THE TEACHERS FIELD NOTEBOOKS. THE EXPERIENCE WAS EXECUTED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DIGITAL FABRICATION CENTRES OF BARCELONA. THE RESULTS WERE ORGANISED TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF USING TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE HIGHER EDUCATION OFFERING AN APPROACH IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE AT THE CENTRE OF THE WHOLE PROCESS. STRENGTHS: STRONG STUDENT MOTIVATION, PROMOTION OF SELF-DIRECTED AND COLLABORATIVE LEARNING AND LEARNING BY DOING, AND FAMILIARISATION WITH A TRANSFORMING INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY AS PROTAGONISTS. WEAKNESSES: HESITANCE AND RESISTANCE TO FACING THE CHALLENGE, MANAGEMENT OF SCARCE TIME, LARGE TIME INVESTMENT BY THE TEACHERS, AND THE DIFFICULTY OF ACHIEVING IN-DEPTH REFLECTION ON HOW DIGITAL FABRICATION COULD BE INTRODUCED IN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS SUCH AS PRIMARY SCHOOL AND NON-FORMAL CONTEXTS. 2019, UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA.

HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT SURVEYS SHOW THAT THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN THE INTENTION OF EDUCATIONAL POLICIES AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY PRACTICED IN NORWEGIAN EDUCATION. THIS GAP HAS OFTEN BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO PRACTITIONERS' SKILL DEFICIENCY. THIS PAPER CHALLENGES THE NOTION OF PRACTITIONERS' SKILL DEFICIENCY AS BEING THE SOLE CAUSAL EXPLANATION FOR LACK OF PROGRESS, AND ATTEMPTS TO EXPLORE THIS THROUGH A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION IN NORWAY AND NEW ZEALAND. OUR ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES, AND BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE CONNECTED TO POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE. THIS ANALYSIS CONTRIBUTES TO A BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITY BEHIND THIS GAP. UNDERSTANDING THE BIGGER PICTURE IS ESSENTIAL FOR BEING ABLE TO WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY TOWARDS DIMINISHING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLICY INTENTIONS AND PRACTICE IN THE FUTURE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT TOP-DOWN GOVERNANCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY COULD CREATE RESISTANCE AMONG TEACHER EDUCATORS. IT COULD THEREFORE BE UNDERSTOOD AS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE REGARDING PROGRESS. PRIORITISING POLICY GOALS ABOVE PEDAGOGICAL GOALS IN THIS FIELD IS CONTRARY TO TEACHERS' UNDERSTANDING OF TEACHER PROFICIENCY. 2018 AUTHOR(S).",2019,HOW DIFFERENT NATIONAL STRATEGIES OF IMPLEMENTING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CAN AFFECT TEACHER EDUCATORS,0

THE PAPER POSITS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION TO EXPLICITLY ENGAGE WITH THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THESE DEVELOPING IDENTITIES TO MINIMISE THE RISK OF DIGITAL INEQUITY, BOTH FOR PSTS' LEARNING AND THAT OF THEIR FUTURE STUDENTS. TWO CENTRAL QUESTIONS ARE ADDRESSED: HOW DID PSTS MAKE SENSE OF THEIR IDENTITIES AS THEY TOOK PART IN AN EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY COURSE? AND WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY ENCOUNTER IN INCORPORATING TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR LEARNING EXPERIENCES? AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY OF A GROUP OF TUTORS AND PARTICIPATING STUDENTS IN AN ONGOING ACTION RESEARCH PROJECT DIRECTED AT REDESIGNED EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION COURSE AT A HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR THIS INQUIRY. BY CRITICALLY INTERROGATING STUDENTS' REFLEXIVE ACCOUNTS AND FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH ACADEMICS TEACHING INTO THE COURSE, THIS INQUIRY HAS INVESTIGATED AND BUILT EMERGING EXPLANATIONS IN RELATION TO IDENTITY AND DIGITAL EQUITY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE OR POLICY: POSITIVE LEARNER AND PROFESSIONAL IDENTITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES. PSTS DEVELOP LEARNER AND PROFESSIONAL IDENTITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE INTERTWINED WITH THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS AND EXPERIENCES WITH TECHNOLOGY.

BACKGROUND IN CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION, UNIVERSITIES INVEST HEAVILY IN THE INTE-GRATION OF LMS WITH TRADITIONAL CLASSROOMS. CONVERSELY, SUCH TECH-NOLOGIES FACE A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE AND NOT ALL LEARNERS ARE SATISFIED WITH LMS SERVICES. IN TURN, THIS LEADS TO THE EXPLOITATION OF SNS INTERACTIVE FEATURES AND SERVICES, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING. HOWEVER, THE SUCCESS OF BOTH SNS AND LMS HAS RARELY BEEN STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPING NATIONS. METHODOLOGY IN THIS STUDY, A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS USED TO COLLECT THE RE-SEARCH DATA.

OPEN UNIVERSITIES HAVE TAKEN ON SIGNIFICANT LOCAL AND GLOBAL ROLES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REGIONS OF INFLUENCE, AND AS SUCH, THEIR ROLES HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE OPEN UNIVERSITY PHENOMENON BY EXAMINING THE CASE OF ANADOLU UNIVERSITY IN TURKEY, A MEGA UNIVERSITY THAT HAS TRANSFORMED INTO WHAT IS NOW A GIGA UNIVERSITY. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH FIRST LOOKS AT OPENNESS IN EDUCATION AND HOW THE CONCEPT ITSELF HAS LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF OPEN UNIVERSITIES, BEFORE TURNING ATTENTION TO ANADOLU UNIVERSITY, WHICH IS A DUAL-MODE, STATE UNIVERSITY WITH AROUND 3 MILLION ENROLLED STUDENTS. OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THIS RESEARCH INCLUDE THE RISE OF ODL AND HOW IT POSITIONED ITSELF WITHIN TURKISH HIGHER EDUCATION; THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ANADOLU UNIVERSITY AND ITS MASSIVENESS, IN TERMS OF STUDENT NUMBERS AND SERVICES PROVIDED; LOCAL AND GLOBAL ODL PRACTICES; LEARNER PROFILES, LEARNING MATERIALS AND SPACES; EXAMS AND ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION PROCESSES; LEARNER SUPPORT SERVICES, AND ANADOLU UNIVERSITY'S CONTRIBUTION, AS AN OPEN UNIVERSITY, TO THE FIELD OF ODL. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AS AN OPEN UNIVERSITY, ANADOLU UNIVERSITY HAS NARROWED THE INFORMATION GAP AND DIGITAL DIVIDE, HAS ENHANCED EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION, AND HAS PROVIDED LIFELONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, AS AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS GONE BEYOND THE CONVENTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF AN OPEN UNIVERSITY, ANADOLU UNIVERSITY SERVES AS A CATALYST OF CHANGE AND INNOVATION IN ITS EMERGENCE AS A ROLE MODEL FOR OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS.

THE EDUCATION PROVIDER TYPICALLY PREDETERMINES WHICH STUDY MODE/ S ARE AVAILABLE FOR EACH COURSE. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF DESIGNING AND TRIALLING A NEW STUDYFLEX STUDENT-CENTRED STUDY MODE AT LA TROBE UNIVERSITY. BY RE-IMAGINING THE CONCEPT OF FLEXIBILITY IN STUDY MODE SELECTION, STUDYFLEX DOES AWAY WITH BRIGHT LINE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ONLINE, BLENDED AND ON-CAMPUS OFFERINGS AND EMPOWERS STUDENTS TO SELF-SELECT AND ADJUST THEIR PREFERRED STUDY MODE PATHWAY WITHIN THEIR SUBJECT AND THROUGHOUT THEIR COURSE. THIS PAPER EXPOSES AND ACTS AS A PRIMER FOR DISCUSSING THE MANY CHALLENGES OF DESIGNING, DEVELOPING, AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH STUDENT-CENTRED STUDY MODE INNOVATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, IT OUTLINES AND EXPANDS UPON THE STUDYFLEX TRIAL CONDUCTED ACROSS SEVERAL SUBJECTS, ITS GENESIS AND JUSTIFICATION, WITH ITS CENTRAL TENET OF DESIGNING SUBJECTS WHICH ALLOW STUDENTS FREEDOM TO MOVE BETWEEN ON-CAMPUS AND ONLINE MODES OF LEARNING WITHIN A SINGLE OFFERING. DISCUSSION EXTENDS TO SIMILAR TRIAL FINDINGS, INCLUDING THE RECENT PILOT BY SOUTHERN CROSS UNIVERSITY OF A CONVERGED DELIVERY MODEL WHICH ATTEMPTED TO MERGE ON-CAMPUS AND ONLINE STUDY MODES INTO A SINGLE CONVERGED MODE.

PARTICULAR EMPHASIS IS PLACED UPON THE IMPERATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE OF ENSURING EQUIVALENCE OF LEARNING EXPERIENCE, IN TERMS OF LEARNING VALUE AND QUALITY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE BESPOKE STUDY MODE PATHWAY CHOSEN BY STUDENTS IN THE STUDYFLEX TRIAL SUBJECTS. THE DISCUSSION CULMINATES IN IDENTIFYING AND HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES POSED BY INNOVATIONS LIKE THE STUDYFLEX PILOT AND ITS PREDECESSORS SUCH AS THE SOUTHERN CROSS UNIVERSITY CONVERGED DELIVERY PILOT. THESE EXTEND TO ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES POSED FOR UNIVERSITIES SEEKING TO ACCOMMODATE STUDENT-CENTRED STUDY MODE FLEXIBILITY AND POTENTIAL AND CURRENT PRACTICAL REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS AFFECTING SUCH INNOVATIONS. FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS EMERGE CONCERNING THE GAP BETWEEN THE VISION OF ALLOWING STUDENTS TO COMPLETE SELF-DETERMINATION INSOFAR AS SELECTION OF STUDY MODE AND THE PRAGMATIC REALITIES OF THE VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS FACING HIGHER EDUCATION PROVIDERS IN SEEKING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN TO REALISE THAT VISION. AT A LOCAL LEVEL, AND AS THE MODEL BECOMES MORE WIDELY ADOPTED, LA TROBE UNIVERSITY TEACHERS WILL NEED TO BE WELL SUPPORTED TO ENSURE THEIR PRACTICES ADAPT TO A NEW TEACHING MODEL, WHILE THE MODEL ITSELF WILL NEED ONGOING CONCERTED DESIGN ATTENTION TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS EXPERIENCE QUALITY LEARNING REGARDLESS OF THEIR STUDY MODE CHOICES. 2019, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG.

THE FOCUS WAS ON THE NEED TO ASSESS THE CAPABILITY OF AI ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS THE MACROECONOMIC DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM DATA RESOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM, THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD), THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION (WIPO), AND THE INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION UNION (ITU). IN ADDITION, THIS STUDY HAS CONSIDERED 19 ECONOMIC INDICATORS TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC OUTCOME OF AI IN SELECTED ECONOMIES OF ASIA-PACIFIC. RESULTS: FROM THE RESULTS, THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2014 AND 2016 WITNESSED CHINA LEADING WITH OVER 25,000 CITABLE DOCUMENTS ON THE AI TOPIC. REGARDING INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE OBSERVED TO PUBLISH OVER 500 TIMES ON THE AI TOPIC, THE COUNTRIES IN THE ASCENDING ORDER INCLUDE CHINA (600), HONG KONG (1,100), AND SINGAPORE (2,000). AS SUCH, THIS STUDY ESTABLISHED THAT ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIES SUCH AS HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE THOUGH HAVE SMALLER POPULATIONS, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO AI RESEARCH; WITH THE SMALL ECONOMIES ALSO HAVING A RELATIVELY HIGHER NUMBER OF COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AMONG THE TOP 1,000 INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH EMPIRICALLY ANALYSES, DURING 19982016 WITH ANNUAL OBSERVATIONS, IT IS FOUND THAT VARIOUS ECONOMIC OUTCOMES OF AI WERE PRESENTED IN 8 ECONOMIES OF TARGETED REGION. LIMITATIONS: AT FIRST, THE FUTURE OUTLOOK OF AI IS JUST DISCUSSED IN CONCEPTUAL MEANING WHILE EMPIRICAL CONTEXT STILL NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED IN UPCOMING STUDIES. AT SECOND, COVERING THE OVERALL SOUTH ASIAN REGION PROVIDES BETTER FINDINGS WITH MORE GENERALIZATION WHICH IS MISSING IN CURRENT RESEARCH. AT THIRD, OTHER DIMENSIONS OF AI AND ECONOMY LIKE IMPLICATION OF AI IMPACT INDEX AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES IS ALSO MISSING IN CURRENT RESEARCH WHICH COULD BE RECONSIDERED IN COMING STUDIES.

DESPITE IMPRESSIVE NOTABLE FEATURES, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS HAS YET TO BE PROVEN. INTRIGUED WITH THIS ISSUE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEARNING VIA MOOCS IN BLENDED LEARNING AND TRADITIONAL CLASSROOMS AMONG UNDERGRADUATE LEARNERS. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WHICH EMPLOYED NON-EQUIVALENT PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUP DESIGN AMONG TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE UNDERGRADUATE ACCOUNTING STUDENTS WAS CONDUCTED IN ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES IN MALAYSIA. THE STUDENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS; EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS TAUGHT VIA MOOCS IN BLENDED LEARNING, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS TAUGHT IN TRADITIONAL CLASSROOMS. THE RESULTS OF PAIRED SAMPLE T-TEST INDICATED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS BETWEEN THE PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS). THE MAGNITUDE OF EFFECT OF THE FORMER WAS HIGHER THAN THE LATTER. THE RESULTS OF MANOVA INDICATED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS BETWEEN GROUPS IN POST-TEST, BUT NOT IN THE PRE-TEST.

HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT PREFERENCES FOR USING SPECIFIC TYPES OF HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE RESOURCES AND HOW PREFERENCES AND USAGE DIFFER BY AGE GROUP AND EDUCATION. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE HOW USE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND PREFERRED METHODS FOR OBTAINING HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE VARIES BY AGE GROUP AND EDUCATION AMONG MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. METHODS: THE STUDY USED CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA FOR 9005 KAISER PERMANENTE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MEMBERS AGED 45 TO 85 YEARS WHO RESPONDED TO A MAILED AND WEB-BASED HEALTH SURVEY CONDUCTED DURING 2014 AND 2015 AND INDICATED HAVING AT LEAST 1 CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION. BIVARIATE ANALYSES AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS WITH WEIGHTED DATA WERE USED TO ESTIMATE AND COMPARE THE PREVALENCE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY USE, PAST-YEAR USE OF INTERNET-BASED HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE RESOURCES, AND PREFERENCES FOR USING INTERNET-BASED, MHEALTH, AND TRADITIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE MODALITIES FOR ADULTS AGED 45 TO 65 YEARS, 66 TO 75 YEARS, AND 76 TO 85 YEARS. RESULTS: THE PERCENTAGES OF ADULTS WHO USED DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (COMPUTERS, SMARTPHONES, INTERNET, EMAIL, AND APPS), HAD OBTAINED HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE FROM AN INTERNET-BASED RESOURCE IN THE PAST YEAR, AND WHO WERE INTERESTED IN USING INTERNET-BASED AND MHEALTH MODALITIES FOR OBTAINING HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE DECLINED WITH AGE. WITHIN AGE GROUP, PREVALENCE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES USE AND INTEREST IN INTERNET-BASED AND MHEALTH MODALITIES WAS LOWER AMONG ADULTS WITH NO COLLEGE EDUCATION VERSUS COLLEGE GRADUATES. DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCES FOR INTERNET-BASED HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE MODALITIES BETWEEN THE OLDEST AND YOUNGER GROUPS AND THOSE WITH LOWER VERSUS HIGHER EDUCATION WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISHED WHEN WE RESTRICTED ANALYSES TO INTERNET USERS. CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND ORGANIZATIONS SERVING MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE OLDER AND LESS EDUCATED, WANT TO ENGAGE WITH INTERNET-BASED AND MHEALTH RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, INCREASING THE ENGAGEMENT OF NONUTILIZERS OF DIGITAL DEVICES AND THE INTERNET WITH INTERNET-BASED HEALTH INFORMATION AND ADVICE AND MHEALTH APPS MIGHT REQUIRE BOTH INSTRUMENTAL (EG, PROVIDING DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVICES, INTERNET, AND SKILLS TRAINING) AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. AS PART OF PATIENT-CENTERED CARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDERS TO ASCERTAIN THEIR PATIENTS' USE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND PREFERENCES FOR OBTAINING HEALTH INFORMATION AND PATIENT EDUCATION RATHER THAN ROUTINELY REFERRING THEM TO INTERNET-BASED RESOURCES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND CONSUMER HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS TO USER TEST THEIR WEB-BASED RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE EASY FOR OLDER AND LESS EDUCATED ADULTS TO USE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REMAINS EASY FOR ADULTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO OBTAIN HEALTH INFORMATION AND PATIENT EDUCATION USING OFFLINE RESOURCES.

FURTHERMORE, MANY OF THE STUDIES RELATE TO THE FIELD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, WITH FEWER STUDIES EXPLORING ADULT LEARNING AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THE STUDIES DEALING WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RELATE MOSTLY TO TEACHERS CONTINUING EDUCATION. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE CONCEPT OF LEARNING ECOLOGIES COULD BE USED TO ADDRESS FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL AND DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH LEADING TO RESEARCH APPLICATIONS IF THERE IS PROPER ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE ONTOLOGICAL, METHODOLOGICAL AND APPLICATIVE DIMENSIONS. THE MAIN POTENTIAL OF THIS STRATEGY LIES IN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPPORTING LEARNERS BY RAISING THEIR AWARENESS OF THEIR OWN LEARNING ECOLOGIES, THEREBY EMPOWERING THEM AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO ENGAGE IN AGENTIC PRACTICES.

"MONITORING OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF STUDENTS AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATIONAL PROCESS [ ] DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES;  EFFICIENCY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS;  FUNCTIONAL AND PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL STATE;  MONITORING AND CONTROL NA INTRODUCTION. THE INCREASING AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES TO BE MASTERED INEVITABLY LEAD TO THE NEED FOR MORE INTENSIVE CLASSROOM AND INDEPENDENT STUDIES. PROVIDING FAVOURABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND AND ENSURING ACTIVE WORKING CONDITION OF A STUDENT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS (EEP). THIS FACT HAS SPECIAL RELEVANCE IN THE ORGANISATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS FOR STUDENTS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES, FOREIGN STUDENTS, AS WELL AS STUDENTS, WHO RECEIVE EDUCATION UNDER INDIVIDUAL EDUCATIONAL TRAJECTORIES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT RESEARCH WAS TO ANALYSE THE POSSIBILITIES AND PROSPECTS FOR INCREASING THE EEP THROUGH CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND CONTROL OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL AND PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL STATE (FPES) OF STUDENTS DIRECTLY IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING TRAINING SESSIONS. METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH METHODS. THE RESEARCH WAS BASED ON: A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE ACCUMULATION, SYSTEMATIZATION AND ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL BIOMETRIC INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS A RELIABLE ASSESSMENT AND FORECAST OF CHANGES IN THE CURRENT FPES OF STUDENTS; IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF BIOFEEDBACK (BF) AND PASSIVE REMOTE NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENTS OF CURRENT HUMAN BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS THAT EXCLUDE ANY IMPACT ON IT. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES WERE USED FOR DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING IN THE OPTICAL AND ACOUSTIC SPECTRA OF NATURAL HUMAN RADIATION. RESULTS AND SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE WORK SUBSTANTIATES AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO PLANNING, ORGANISING AND CONDUCTING TRAINING SESSIONS, AS WELL AS CONTROL MEASURES, WHICH ALLOW INCREASING THE EEP BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CAPABILITIES OF STUDENTS USING MODERN DIGITAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES TO MONITOR THEIR CURRENT FPES. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SYSTEM PARAMETERS CHARACTERISING HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) CAN BE USED TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION OF STUDENTS TO THE LEARNING PROCESS IN GENERAL, AS WELL AS THEIR RESPONSES TO THE COMPLEXITY OF TRAINING AND CONTROL ACTIVITIES. SYSTEMIC PARAMETERS INCLUDE THE VEGETATIVE EQUILIBRIUM INDEX (VBI), THE VEGETATIVE INDEX OF RHYTHM (VPR), THE INDICATOR OF THE ADEQUACY OF REGULATORY PROCESSES (PAID) AND THE STRESS INDEX OF REGULATORY SYSTEMS (IN). THE PARAMETER IN IS HIGHLIGHTED AS THE MOST INFORMATIVE. THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE DYNAMICS IN THE PARAMETER IN FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT FPES OF TRAINEES IS DEMONSTRATED. THE POSSIBILITY AND EXPEDIENCY OF USING EMBEDDED MONITORING SYSTEMS HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTALLY CONFIRMED. THE BIO-MOUSE AND BIOMETRIC CHAIR ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNIVERSAL MEANS OF MONITORING THE CURRENT FPES OF STUDENTS BOTH IN THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION AND AT HOME (IN A HOSTEL ENVIRONMENT).

TRANSITION TO A POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AND INFORMATION SOCIETY CAUSED EDUCATION CRISIS, WHICH IS COMMON FOR WORLD SPACE. DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGIES AND RAPID OBSOLESCENCE OF KNOWLEDGE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED LIFE CYCLE OF PROFESSIONS AND CAUSED DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE SPHERE OF EMPLOYMENT. THE NEED OF ECONOMICS FOR WORKERS WITH QUALITATIVELY NEW QUALIFICATION CHARACTERISTICS - A FLEXIBLE PERSON WITH META-PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCIES, CAPABLE TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROFESSIONAL PROBLEMS AND READY FOR INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY NOT JUST FOR TODAY, BUT WITH THE FUTURE IN MIND - HAS NECESSITATED A SIGNIFICANT UPDATING OF THE SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND ITS REORGANI-SATION FACILITATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FORMULA LIFELONG LEARNING. THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION BEGINS WITH QUALITATIVE TRAINING OF TEACHERS, SINCE THE QUALITIES OF FUTURE PROFESSIONALS - GRADUATES OF THE EDUCATIONAL ORGANISATION, PRIMARILY DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF TEACHERS' COMPETENCIES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE IS TO DETERMINE THE STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS OF INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND PREPARATION OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEDAGOGICAL PERSONNEL. METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH METHODS. THE HYPOTHETICO-INDUCTIVE METHOD, THEORETIC-METHODOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS OF THE CONTENT OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WERE THE MAJOR RESEARCH METHODS. THE RESEARCH WORK WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONVERGENCE, WHICH DETERMINES CROSS-DISCIPLINARY AND SUPRA-PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATIONS, ACTS AS A FACTOR OF DESIGN AND A STATEMENT IN PROFESSIOLOGY OF A NEW PHENOMENON - TRANSPROFESSIONALISM. THE AUTHORS DESCRIBED THE CONCEPT OF TRANSPROFESSIONALISM THROUGH THE PROCESS- AND PROJECT-BASED APPROACHES. RESULTS AND SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS AND DIRECTIONS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ARE CONSIDERED. THE PRINCIPAL DEFINING FACTOR OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IS CLOSE INTEGRATION OF ALL ITS PROCESSES AND SUBSYSTEMS (PREVOCATIONAL TRAINING - SECONDARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION - HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS - POSTGRADUATE TRAINING), WHICH INTEGRITY IS PROVIDED BY THE CONTINUING AND ADVANCED EDUCATION. THE CONCEPT OF TRANSPROFESSIONALISM AND CONVERGENCE IN MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRAINING OF SPECIALISTS IS PROVED. THE INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES BASED ON THIS CONCEPT ARE CHARACTERISED. THE LOGICAL-SEMANTIC MODEL OF A MODERN SPECIALIST IS DESIGNED. THIS MODEL CAN FORM AN EMPIRICAL BASIS TO DESIGN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PLATFORM, WHICH INTEGRATES SOCIO-HUMANISTIC, NATURAL-SCIENCE DISCIPLINES AND RELATED INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR TEACHERS' TRAINING IN THE SYSTEM OF CONTINUING VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.

THIS IS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR RURAL AREAS IN AUSTRALIA THAT FACE SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL INEQUITIES INCLUDING A SCARCITY OF HEALTH RESOURCES. E-HEALTH INITIATIVES ARE OFTEN PROPOSED TO MAXIMISE THE NUMBER OF RURAL MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS ABLE TO RECEIVE SUPPORT. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS PRIORITISED E-HEALTH WITHIN THE REMIT OF THE AUSTRALIAN DIGITAL HEALTH AGENCY AND THE NATIONAL DIGITAL HEALTH STRATEGY. HOWEVER, DESPITE INCREASING INTEREST IN E-HEALTH IN POLICY AND PRACTICE SETTINGS, UPTAKE HAS BEEN UNDERWHELMING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE LIKELY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTERNET, BOTH FOR GENERAL AND E-HEALTH PURPOSES, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SOUTH AUSTRALIAN RURAL MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS. THE FOCUS WAS ON PSYCHOSOCIAL PREDICTORS, WHICH EMBRACED INTRINSIC (MOTIVATION), AS WELL AS EXTRINSIC FACTORS CONCERNING EQUITY, SUCH AS INCOME, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS IN THIS QUANTITATIVE STUDY INCLUDED 208 MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS IN RURAL SOUTH AUSTRALIA WHO HAD RECENTLY ACCESSED A LOCAL HEALTH NETWORK MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. DATA WERE SOURCED FROM THE SERVICE'S CLINICAL MANAGEMENT DATABASE AND A QUESTIONNAIRE CONSTRUCTED FOR THE STUDY. THE QUESTIONNAIRE INCLUDED MEASURES OF PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, MOTIVES, EQUITY AND INTERNET USE. RESULTS: MOTIVES AND EQUITY-RELATED VARIABLES WERE DIRECTLY LINKED TO GENERAL INTERNET USE, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY AFFECTED THE LIKELIHOOD OF USING THE INTERNET FOR HEALTH PURPOSES. INTRINSIC RATHER THAN EXTRINSIC FACTORS WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS OF INTERNET USE; THAT IS, HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL INTERNET USE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING YOUNGER, HAVING STRONGER MOTIVATION, GREATER TRUST, HIGHER EDUCATION, BEING EMPLOYED, HAVING A HIGHER INCOME AND HAVING HOME INTERNET ACCESS. FOR HEALTH INTERNET USE, THE IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WERE MORE MODEST AND INCLUDED ONLY BEING YOUNGER, HAVING STRONGER MOTIVATION, AND GREATER TRUST. THE MODEL INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO DIRECT PREDICTORS OF INTERNET USE FOR HEALTH BEYOND USE OF THE INTERNET FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. HOWEVER, KEY STUDY VARIABLES PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INDIRECT PATHS TO HEALTH INTERNET USE. GENERAL INTERNET USE WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY MOTIVATION, AND AGE AND EQUITY TO A LESSER EXTENT. MOTIVATION WAS INFLUENCED BY TRUST, AND AGE AND EQUITY, WITH TRUST ALSO INFLUENCED BY AGE AND EQUITY. CONCLUSION: THIS QUANTITATIVE INVESTIGATION SOUGHT TO DESCRIBE THE BARRIERS TO AND ENABLERS OF INTERNET USE GENERALLY, BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BEFORE PEOPLE WILL USE THE INTERNET FOR HEALTH, THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED TO USE IT FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. THE MODEL PROPOSED IN THE CURRENT RESEARCH OFFERS AN INDICATION OF SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE RURAL MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS' USE OF THE INTERNET FOR BOTH GENERAL AND HEALTH PURPOSES. TO APPROPRIATELY DESIGN FUTURE E-HEALTH INITIATIVES, THE INITIAL FOCUS MUST BE ON CONSUMERS' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TO USE THE INTERNET GENERALLY. POLICYMAKERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ACUTELY INTERESTED IN LEVERAGING INTERNET USE TO FACILITATE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. UNDERSTANDING THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT RURAL MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS' USE OF THE INTERNET IN GENERAL IS BENEFICIAL IN INFORMING THE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND THE APPROPRIATE DESIGN OF E-HEALTH INITIATIVES TO PRODUCE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS.

"ABOUT RELEVANCE OF FUNDAMENTALISATION OF MATHEMATICAL TRAINING OF STUDENTS OF THE PEDAGOGICAL DIRECTIONS DURING THE DIGITAL ERA [ ] DIGITAL ERA;  FUNDAMENTALISATION OF MATHEMATICAL TRAINING OF STUDENTS;  MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION;  PEDAGOGICAL DIRECTIONS STUDENTS OF PEDAGOGICAL DIRECTIONS OF TRAINING NA INTRODUCTION. THE ERA OF POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY OF KNOWLEDGE DIFFERS FROM THE PREVIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERIOD IN MANY IMPORTANT ASPECTS: TOTAL DIGITALISATION, AUTOMATION AND ROBOTISATION, AND FURTHERMORE, CROSS-DISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC FIELDS, AMONG WHICH MATHEMATICS IS OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE. OVER THE LAST DECADES, THE LANGUAGE, TOOLS AND METHODS OF THE DIGITAL ERA HAVE EMERGED AS THE BASIC UNIVERSAL RESEARCH TOOLS IN PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, AND ENGINEERING, ORGANISATION OF PRODUCTION AND IN MANY OTHER THEORETICAL AND APPLIED SPHERES OF ACTIVITY. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF PROGRESSIVELY ADVANCED MATHEMATISATION, WHICH COVERS LARGER FUNCTIONAL INTELLECTUAL SPACE, IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE FUNDAMENTAL, ADVANCING NATURE OF MATHEMATICAL TRAINING OF STUDENTS, INCLUDING IN THE FIRST PLACE THE STUDENTS OF THE PEDAGOGICAL DIRECTIONS. THE GRADUATES OF PEDAGOGICAL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WILL HAVE NOT ONLY TO CONVEY CERTAIN ACADEMIC EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION, BUT TO COORDINATE EDUCATIONAL TRAJECTORIES ACCORDING TO A TRAINING MAXIM IN THEIR LIFETIME THAT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC MATHEMATICS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT PUBLICATION IS TO DISCUSS METHODOLOGICAL, CULTUROLOGICAL AND DIDACTIC ASPECTS OF MATHEMATICAL TRAINING OF STUDENTS OF THE PEDAGOGICAL DIRECTIONS. METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH METHODS. IN THE COURSE OF THE WORK, THE AUTHORS USED THE PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW FEDERAL STATE EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS (FSES). THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE CONCEPTS OF DEVELOPING LEARNING AND UPBRINGING, VOCATIONAL AND PEDAGOGICAL ORIENTATION OF TRAINING OF FUTURE TEACHERS AND THE IDEA OF LIFELONG EDUCATION. THE ANALYTICAL REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF THE CONTENT OF PHILOSOPHICAL, MATHEMATICAL, PEDAGOGICAL, METHODOLOGICAL LITERATURE AND NORMATIVE DOCUMENTS WAS CONDUCTED. THE STATE OF MATHEMATICAL COMPONENTS OF PEDAGOGICAL EDUCATION AND ITS WAYS OF FUNDAMENTALISATION WERE CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF TRAINING, COMPARATIVE, CULTUROLOGICAL AND SYSTEM-BASED TYPES OF ANALYSIS. RESULTS AND SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE AUTHORS NOTE THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL PREPARATION, WHICH IS RELEVANT FOR A MODERN PERSON, AND THE COMPETENCY-BASED APPROACH, WHICH CURRENTLY DOMINATES IN EDUCATION AND CONSTRAINTS TO STUDENTS' HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF MATHEMATICAL AREA OF KNOWLEDGE, EVEN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF A PARTICULAR DISCIPLINE. THE SITUATION IS EXACERBATED BY AN AVALANCHE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. ONE OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SITUATION IS REPLACEMENT OF MEANINGFUL LEARNING OF MATHEMATICS WITH COACHING OF SCHOOL STUDENTS AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FOR FORMAL TEST PERFORMANCE. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, CULTUROLOGICAL EDUCATIONAL MODELS, WHICH FORM COMMON CULTURAL IDEAS OF MODERN MATHEMATICS ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A CULTURAL CONFORMITY, HAVE TO BE THE PREDOMINANT IN EDUCATION, BUT NOT COMPETENCY-BASED ATTITUDES FOCUSED ON NARROW SPECIALISATION. MATHEMATICAL MO-DELLING, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION PROCESSES ARE IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF A NEW STAGE OF UNIVERSAL MATHEMATICAL CULTURE EVOLUTION. AS A RESULT OF A DIGITAL ERA, GENERAL-EDUCATION CONCEPTS HAVE ALREADY BECOME THE KEY CONCEPTS OF VARIOUS SECTIONS OF MATHEMATICS, THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO START A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THESE CONCEPTS AT THE STAGES OF SCHOOL EDUCATION. IT IS HIGHLIGHTED THAT FUNDAMENTALISATION OF MATHEMATICAL PREPARATION PLAYS THE LEADING ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOGICAL AND PROFESSIONAL INNOVATIVE THINKING OF STUDENTS THROUGH THE UNDERSTANDING OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL STRUCTURES AND SCHEMES (AS MEANS AND KNOWLEDGE METHODS) SIMILAR TO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES AND SCHEMES. IT IS APPROPRIATELY USEFUL TO INCLUDE SPECIAL COURSES INTO A VARIABLE PART OF THE MASTER'S PROGRAMMES (ACCORDING TO EDUCATION DIRECTIONS), IMPLYING STUDENTS' RESEARCH ACTIVITIES: MATHEMATICAL MODELLING IN PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, BASES OF MODERN MATHEMATICAL CULTURE, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, MATHEMATICAL BASES OF THE SYSTEM ANALYSIS, ETC. THE AUTHORS ARE CONVINCED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CONCEPT OF MATHEMATICAL PREPARATION, BASED ON THE CULTUROLOGICAL AND SYSTEM-BASED APPROACHES, WILL HELP TO RESOLVE AN APPARENT CONTRADICTION BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, THE NECESSARY INTEGRATION AND FUNDAMENTALISATION OF KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED BY STUDENTS, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DISCIPLINARY DISSOCIATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL, SHORTCOMINGS OF COMPETENCY-BASED TRAINING AND FORMAL USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE MATERIALS OF THE PUBLICATION CAN BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE AND PRACTICING TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS, COMPUTER SCIENCE AND RELATED ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES.

"OPEN ACCESS AND DISTANCE EDUCATION: NEW CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE [ACESSO ABERTO E EDUCAO A DISTNCIA: NOVAS CONFIGURAES PARA A DEMOCRATIZAO DO CONHECIMENTO] [ACCESO ABIERTO Y EDUCACIN A DISTANCIA: NUEVAS CONFIGURACIONES PARA LA DEMOCRATIZACIN DEL CONOCIMIENTO] DEMOCRATIZATION OF ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE;  DISTANCE EDUCATION;  LIBRARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;  OPEN ACCESS NA OPEN ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE HAS HELPED TO LEVERAGE THE COMMUNICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS AMONG DIFFERENT EXPERTS AND IN VARIOUS FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE. THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCATING DISCOVERIES WITHOUT ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IN ADDITION TO PUTTING SCIENTISTS IN TOUCH WITH ADVANCES AND NOVELTIES, ALSO ALLOWS THE FORMATION OF CONTACT AND INTERACTION NETWORKS, FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEEPER STUDIES BASED ON INTERDISCIPLINARITY AND COLLABORATION.. HOWEVER, OPEN ACCESS IS NOT ONLY LIMITED TO THE BENEFITS PROMOTED TO SCIENTISTS. IT ENSURES THAT SOCIETY CAN UNDERSTAND THE FLOW OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION AND ALSO ENJOY THE BENEFITS ACHIEVED THROUGH DISCOVERY. THIS PUTS PEOPLE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING, FAVORING THE CONSOLIDATION OF MANY SOCIAL RIGHTS, SUCH AS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND EDUCATION. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS REFLECTION OF OPEN ACCESS IN SOCIETY, IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT IT DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE SOCIAL CONTEXT, CONTRIBUTING TO CITIZEN PRACTICE. THUS, BY FOSTERING CITIZENSHIP THROUGH DEMOCRATIC AND FREE ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE, SOCIETY IS BEING PROTECTED FROM ITS RIGHTS AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE, REPRESENTED MAINLY BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, IN PARTICULAR. RETURN TO SOCIETY WHAT IT IS ENTITLED TO, SINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS CARRIED OUT FROM PROJECTS AND INVESTMENTS SPENT ON PUBLIC RESOURCES. BY ACCESSING KNOWLEDGE IN A DEMOCRATIC MANNER, WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OF ANY KIND, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NEW QUESTIONS MAY BE PRODUCED, WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE. MOREOVER, BY ACCESSING KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION, CITIZENS BECOME EDUCATED THROUGH ACCESS TO EDUCATION, WHICH TRIGGERS THE BIRTH OF A SOCIETY MADE UP OF CRITICAL CITIZENS, CAPABLE OF CHANGING THE REALITY IN WHICH THEY LIVE, AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR FOR PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATION. OPEN ACCESS IS BELIEVED TO BE STRICTLY RELATED TO EDUCATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION. THIS RELATIONSHIP CAN BE EXPLAINED NOT ONLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE TRANSFORMATION THAT KNOWLEDGE PROMOTES, BUT ALSO, THE EFFECTS CAUSED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SOFTWARE, WHICH BEGAN TO BE DEVELOPED AND MADE POSSIBLE THE ORIGIN OF NEW EDUCATIONAL FORMS, FOR EXAMPLE. AS IT HAPPENS WITH DISTANCE EDUCATION. THIS EDUCATIONAL MODALITY HAS ITS ORIGINS IN THE LAST DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND HAS EVOLVED IN RECENT YEARS, THANKS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERACTIVE PLATFORMS THAT DEFINITIVELY ELIMINATE THE LIMITATIONS OF TIME AND SPACE. IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, IN BRAZIL, EFFORTS ARE MADE TO ALLOW EDUCATION TO BE CARRIED TO ALL CORNERS OF THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN REGIONS FAR FROM THE MAJOR URBAN CENTERS, SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ITS POPULARIZATION. THE CREATION OF THE OPEN UNIVERSITY OF BRAZIL IN 2005 REPRESENTED ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION. SINCE THEN, PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES DEVELOP AND MANAGE PROJECTS AIMED AT THE CREATION OF DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES, AND ENCOURAGE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE ENTIRE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, SO THAT THIS FORM OF EDUCATION IS CARRIED OUT WITH QUALITY AND EXCELLENCE. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES REQUIRED IN THE CLASSROOM, AND FOSTER THE DEMANDS REQUIRED IN PROJECTS AIMED AT TEACHING, RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. THUS, THIS STUDY PRESENTS REFLECTIONS ON OPEN ACCESS, DISTANCE EDUCATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE, WHOSE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE INFORMATIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TO STUDENTS OF DISTANCE EDUCATION, POINTING OUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OPEN ACCESS IN THIS CONTEXT. OPEN ACCESS IS A MOVEMENT THAT HAS LED TO CHANGES IN THE FLOW OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, RECONFIGURING THE ROLES PLAYED BY THE DIFFERENT ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION, CIRCULATION AND DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE. ITS ORIGINS LIE IN THE DECLARATION OF THE BUDAPEST OPEN ACCESS INITIATIVE, THE FRUIT OF THE MEETING HELD ON DECEMBER 1 AND 2, 2001, IN BUDAPEST, AT WHICH ACTIONS WERE PROMOTED THAT PROMOTED FORMS OF DEMOCRATIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE. TO THIS END, OPEN ACCESS ADVOCATES [] A MODEL OF DEMOCRATIC ACCESS TO CONTENT AND TOOLS (SOFTWARE) AS A WAY OF ENABLING THE UNIVERSALIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE (LIMA, 2009, P. 223). THE ATTEMPT TO ALLOW FREE ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ONLY LIMITED TO THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, SOMETHING PECULIAR TO SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS, BUT ALSO INCLUDES BROADER ISSUES, SINCE THESE ACTIONS ALSO IMPACT SOCIAL PRACTICES, DAILY LIFE. THEREFORE, THROUGH ACCESS, DEMOCRATIZATION / UNIVERSALIZATION IS GUARANTEED (LIMA, 2009). FOR VARELA, BARBOSA AND GUIMARES (2009, P. 124), IN THE CONTEXT OF OPEN ACCESS, THE DISCUSSION IS NOT ONLY TECHNOLOGICAL, BUT ALSO IMPLICIT IN IT [] THE SOCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS, OBTAINED THROUGH THE SOCIALIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE, RESULTING FROM THE DEMOCRATIZATION POLICY OF EDUCATION, THE CREATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES, MUSEUMS, THE INTERNET [] "". ALSO NOTEWORTHY IS THE EMERGENCE OF THE SEMANTIC WEB, WHICH HAS BROUGHT EVEN MORE SOPHISTICATED RESOURCES, ABLE TO BRING THE KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUALS CLOSER AND CLOSER. WITH THESE FEATURES, THE COLLABORATION OF THE VARIOUS SOCIAL ACTORS VIA THE NETWORK IS MANIFESTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS WIKI, TWITTER, MSN, DISCUSSION FORUMS, ETC. THE IMPACT OF OPEN ACCESS WAS SUCH THAT TRIGGERED THE EMERGENCE [] OF NEW FORMS OF LEARNING AND ALLOWED THE CONSTRUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY, BREAKING UNILATERALITY AND SCIENTIFIC HEGEMONY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE (VARELA; BARBOSA; GUIMARES, 2009, P. 124). DISTANCE EDUCATION IS STRENGTHENED FROM THIS PHILOSOPHY AND REAFFIRMS THE ROLE OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN ENSURING QUALITY EDUCATION AND EXCELLENCE, IN THE SAME PARAMETERS AS CLASSROOM EDUCATION. THROUGH DISTANCE EDUCATION, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COURSES OFFERED, AS WELL AS CREATE CONDITIONS FOR TEACHING-LEARNING TO TAKE PLACE THROUGH THE USE OF DIGITAL RESOURCES OFFERED ON THE INTERNET. BOTH AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND IN BRAZIL, THIS NEW MODALITY OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN EXPANDING, PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF HIGHER EDUCATION, WHICH BECOMES INCREASINGLY ACCESSIBLE (MARTINS; ZERBINI, 2014). REIS (2009) EMPHASIZES THAT DISTANCE EDUCATION BRINGS FREEDOM TO THOSE INVOLVED WITH THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. HOWEVER, IT STRESSES THAT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS NEED TO OFFER INCREASINGLY ATTRACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, BECAUSE THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS, IN ANY CONTEXT THAT TAKES PLACE, CANNOT CAUSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN STUDENT AND TEACHER. ON THE CONTRARY, DISTANCE EDUCATION BRINGS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS CLOSER TOGETHER, EVEN IF IT HAPPENS IN VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. THEREFORE, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES REPRESENT THE MAIN ELEMENT THAT LED TO THE BIRTH AND EXPANSION OF DISTANCE LEARNING. IT IS THROUGH THE INTERNET, THROUGH THE USE OF ITS TOOLS SUCH AS MSN, E-MAIL, SKYPE, ETC., THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO [] DEVELOP VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, BECOMING A PEDAGOGICAL MEDIATION MECHANISM, INCREASING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE CONSTRUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE ""(REIS, 2009, P. 2). HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, SPECIFICALLY UNIVERSITIES, PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ENSURING THE ADEQUATE PROVISION OF DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES, ESPECIALLY AS THEY PROVIDE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENABLES EDUCATIONAL MEDIATION VIA DIGITAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, THEY NEED TO TRAIN TEACHERS, STUDENTS AND TUTORS IN THE USE OF THESE RESOURCES IN ORDER FOR LEARNING TO HAPPEN EFFECTIVELY (VIEIRA ET AL. 2012). IT IS NOTICED THAT DISTANCE EDUCATION IS MANIFEST AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ENSURE THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF EDUCATION, WITH UNIVERSITIES PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE MANAGED BY OFFERING RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF TECHNOLOGY-MEDIATED TEACHING. IN ADDITION TO THE CREATION OF DISTANCE EDUCATION SUPPORT CENTERS, THE INSTITUTIONS STRUCTURE THE ON-CAMPUS SUPPORT POLES, ALLOWING STUDENTS TO GET CLOSER TO THE INSTITUTION (VIEIRA, 2014). IN ORDER TO MATERIALIZE, DISTANCE EDUCATION REQUIRES THE USE OF MATERIALS TO SUPPORT EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH IMPLIES THAT UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES MUST ENSURE THE EXPANSION OF LIBRARY SERVICES BEYOND THE WALLS OF INSTITUTIONS, BRINGING QUALITY EDUCATION TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY. NATION, AS PROPOSED BY THE OPEN UNIVERSITY OF BRAZIL (VIEIRA, 2014). THIS STUDY HAS DESCRIPTIVE AND EXPLORATORY CHARACTERISTICS, AS IT IDENTIFIES CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF AN OBJECT IN A GIVEN CONTEXT, IN ORDER TO GATHER INFORMATION IN ORDER TO PROPOSE IMPROVEMENTS IN FUTURE STUDIES. IN ADDITION, REGARDING THE TECHNICAL PROCEDURES, THREE STEPS WERE PERFORMED: STEP 1: BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN SELECTED ARTICLES AND BOOKS THAT DISCUSS THE SUBJECT. THIS ANALYSIS WAS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY WHICH SERVICES CAN BE OFFERED BY UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TO DISTANCE EDUCATION STUDENTS; STEP 2: DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH ON THE WEBSITE OF A HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION, IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF COURSES, ONSITE SUPPORT POLES THAT TEACH THESE COURSES AND THE ACADEMIC UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COURSE MANAGEMENT; STEP 3: CASE STUDY, BY APPLYING A QUESTIONNAIRE TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OF THE DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES AND USING PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION. FOR BOTH DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH AND CASE STUDY, THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF MINAS GERAIS WAS CHOSEN AS THE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT. FROM THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE APPLICATION OF THIS METHOD, IT IS BELIEVED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH, CARRIED OUT IN ALL BRAZILIAN FEDERAL UNIVERSITIES - AIMING AT A NATIONAL PANORAMA - IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION RESOURCES USED BY STUDENTS AND POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OPEN ACCESS IN THE USE OF THESE RESOURCES. WITH THE LITERATURE REVIEW, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INFORMATIONAL PRODUCTS / SERVICES COMMONLY OFFERED BY UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES ARE: COLLECTION, DATABASES, THE DIGITAL LIBRARY OF THESES AND DISSERTATIONS, ONLINE CATALOG, BIBLIOGRAPHIC SWITCHING SERVICE AND THE CAPES JOURNAL PORTAL. THROUGH PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, IT WAS REALIZED THAT ALL THE ELEMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE LITERATURE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN DISTANCE LEARNING, THE UNIVERSITY MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS, AND TWO ARE NOT OPEN ACCESS, AND THE INSTITUTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING SO THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SOME COMMERCIAL DATABASES AND THE CAPES PORTAL. FROM THE DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH, IT WAS FOUND THAT UFMG HAS BEEN ACTING AS A PARTNER OF THE OPEN UNIVERSITY OF BRAZIL, OFFERING FIVE DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES, WHICH ARE OFFERED IN 34 CITIES (POLES), MOSTLY PRESENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE, INCLUDING CITIES WITH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC AND POPULATION LEVELS. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED THAT THESE HUBS OFFER DIFFERENT PEDAGOGICAL AND INFORMATIONAL ACTIVITIES, BEING MANAGED THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UNIVERSITY, STATE AND CITY HALLS. THE RESULTS FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE SHOW THAT ONLY 28.68% OF STUDENTS KNOW THE LIBRARY COLLECTION WELL, AND LESS THAN 9% OF STUDENTS KNOW THE OTHER PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR ACADEMIC AND SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES. ALLIED TO THIS QUESTION, WE ASKED ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF SERVICES AND PRODUCTS OFFERED AT THE CENTERS, WHERE MOST STUDENTS USE THE LIBRARY COLLECTION ONLY ONCE A MONTH, AND ONLY 13.49% CONSULT EVERY DAY. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS A PREDOMINANCE OF USE, SOME CHALLENGES WERE OBSERVED, SUCH AS DISTANCE FROM THE POLE, LACK OF ADEQUATE MATERIAL TO THE NEEDS AND GREATER DISSEMINATION OF SERVICES, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE PROVISION OF DIGITAL SERVICES, REFERRING TO THE NEED FOR INTERVENING AND MEDIATING ACTIONS BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, THE DISTANCE EDUCATION SUPPORT CENTERS AND THE LIBRARIES IN THE ONSITE SUPPORT CENTERS. AMONG THE ELEMENTS INVESTIGATED, ACCESS TO SOME DATABASES AND THE CAPES JOURNAL PORTAL, ALTHOUGH IT COVERS ACCESS FEES, THESE ARE FUNDED BY THE INSTITUTION, WHICH REINFORCES THE INSTITUTIONS INTEREST IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION OFFERED TO STUDENTS. THIS FACT DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL OF OPEN ACCESS, AS IT WOULD ELIMINATE THIS KIND OF OBSTACLE FOR INSTITUTIONS, STRENGTHENING THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION. FROM THESE DATA, WE CAN INFER ABOUT THE NEED TO ESTABLISH INTERVENTIONAL MEASURES, GIVEN THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF WHAT IS OFFERED. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO EQUIP THE LIBRARIES OF THE POLES, WITH VAST AND VARIED COLLECTIONS, AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE COLLECTION REQUESTED IN THE BASIC BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE COURSES, AS WELL AS GUIDANCE AND TRAINING ON HOW TO USE EXISTING ONLINE INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES., SEEKING BETTER USABILITY OF ITS INFORMATION RESOURCES BY THE CONSULTANT. 2019, BRAZILIAN INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.

TO OBTAIN ALL THIS INFORMATION AROUND THE COUNTRY, A DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY WAS APPLIED, WHICH WE NAMED THE DISTRIBUTED ACCESS RESEARCH STRATEGY (DARS). ALL THE DATA WAS COLLECTED BY TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS FROM TWO PROGRAMS OF THE FACULTY OF EDUCATION, CORPORACION UNIVERSITARIA IBEROAMERICANA IN COLOMBIA. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT MOST PRESCHOOLS AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS HAVE DOCUMENTED INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATIONAL PLANS REFERENCING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION FOR THEIR STUDENTS, BUT THEY HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN ESTABLISHING STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT CURRICULAR ADAPTATIONS WITHIN THEIR CONTEXTS, AS WELL AS WITH THE USE OF TRACKING INSTRUMENTS. THESE RESULTS GENERATED A REFLECTION FOR REVIEWING THE SYLLABUS AND STUDY PLANS IN THE TERTIARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT THIS UNIVERSITY TO BETTER PREPARE FUTURE TEACHERS WHO WILL FACE SUCH SCENARIOS IN THEIR LOCATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MOREOVER, THIS NEW DARS DATA-COLLECTION STRATEGY SHOWS AN INTERESTING POTENTIAL, WHICH IS GENERIC ENOUGH TO ENABLE UNLIMITED RESEARCH TOPICS TO BE EXPLORED WITHIN DISTANCE LEARNING CONTEXTS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE OR POLICY: UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS CAN LEVERAGE A DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY BASED ON THE DISTRIBUTED STUDENTS' SOCIAL NETWORK CONNECTIONS.

THIS FACILITATION OCCURRED WHILE THE STUDENTS USED SMARTPHONES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS TO CREATE VISUAL ASSESSMENT EPORTFOLIOS. BACKGROUND TO ENCOURAGE INDEPENDENCE AND PEER COLLABORATION, WHEN CREATING THEIR VISUAL EPORTFOLIOS, THE LECTURER DECIDED TO GET HIS STUDENTS TO USE BYOD MOBILE DEVIC-ES, AND SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATIONS TO RECORD THEIR LEARNING OF TECHNICAL SKILLS. HIS INTENTION WAS TO MAKE USE OF THE DEVICES THEY BROUGHT TO CLASS, AND TO ENABLE GREATER AUTONOMY AND FLEXIBILITY IN THE LEARNING PROCESS BY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR DIGITAL CAMERAS AND PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN USING. THE LECTURER ALSO SAW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MORE FREQUENT AND IMMEDI-ATE FORMATIVE FEEDBACK, AND TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO SHARE THEIR WORK. METHODOLOGY A PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED WITH FIFTEEN CERTIFICATE LEVEL STUDENTS. THEY WERE GUIDED IN THE USE OF THREE SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATIONS (APPS) - FACEBOOK, EVERNOTE AND GOOGLE PLUS (G+) THAT THEY COULD USE ON THEIR SMARTPHONES TO DEVELOP EPORTFOLIOS FOR ASSESSMENT. BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUAL-ITATIVE DATA WAS COLLECTED DURING FOUR ACTION CYCLES, AND THE OUTCOMES ARE POR-TRAYED AS A CASE STUDY. SEVERAL SAMPLING METHODS WERE USED: A STUDENT PRE-SURVEY, AND POST-SURVEY, OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS BY THE LECTURER, FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS AND AN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW WITH THE LECTURER. FOR THIS ARTICLE, A FRAMEWORK BASED ON ESTABLISHED FACTORS OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE FINDINGS TO ESTABLISH THE IMPACT OF THE TEACHER. CONTRIBUTION THIS PAPER EXTENDS THE BODY OF RESEARCH ABOUT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT WITH A FO-CUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TEACHER IN SUPPORTING 21ST CENTURY VOCATIONAL LEARNING AND EPORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. FINDINGS THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THE LEARNING APPROACH USING THE THREE APPLICATIONS AND THEIR MOBILE PHONES, AND FELT CONFIDENT WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES. OVERALL, THEY FOUND THE LEARNING APPROACH WAS MORE CONVENIENT AND MADE THE EXPERIENCE EASIER, AS WELL AS ENJOYABLE AND FUN. STUDENTS BELIEVED THAT MOBILE LEARNING HELPED THEIR LEARNING AND ASSISTED THEM TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS. ALL THREE APPS WERE CONSIDERED EASY TO ACCESS. FACEBOOK WAS THE MOST PREFERRED APP WITH GOOGLE PLUS (G+) THE LEAST LIKED. EVERNOTE WAS FAVOURED FOR ITS IMAGE EDITING AND ANNOTATION FEATURES. STUDENTS RESPONDED WELL TO THE LECTURER'S TEACHING METHODS AND THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT HE CREATED. HE WAS FOUND TO BE PIVOTAL TO THE LEARNING PROCESS. AS A RESULT OF THE LECTURER'S LEARNING AND ASSESSMENT DESIGN, STUDENTS ENHANCED THEIR ACHIEVEMENT RATES. HE SCAFFOLDED THEIR USE OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH: DEMONSTRATING AND MODELLING EACH APP AT THE START OF THE CYCLE OF USE, USE OF TECHNOLOGIES DURING THEIR LEARNING, AND BY PROVIDING PROMPT, FREQUENT AND TIMELY FEEDBACK ON THEIR EPORTFOLIO WORK. SINCE HE ENABLED THEM TO USE DE-VICES FAMILIAR TO THEM, THAT IS, SMARTPHONES, HE HELPED THEM TO DEVELOP AUTON-OMY AND CONFIDENCE. THE LECTURER WAS SUPPORTIVE AND ENTHUSIASTIC AND ENCOURAGED STUDENTS THROUGH STRUCTURED AND WELL-DESIGNED COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE LEARNING THAT CHALLENGED THEM, AND ENCOURAGED COLLABORATION. HE GUIDED THEM IN THEIR LEARNING THROUGH REGULARLY INTERACTING WITH THEM TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK, AND HE ALSO ADDED AN ASPECT OF COMPETITIVENESS TO THE ACTIVITIES TO MOTIVATE THEM. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS TEACHING STAFF ARE ADVISED TO SEEK GUIDANCE WHEN DESIGNING LEARNING ACTIVITIES USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES, AND TO ACCESS TECHNICAL SUPPORT. COCHRANE'S (2014) SIX CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR DESIGNING LEARNING USING MOBILE DEVICES WOULD ASSIST. ALSO, IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO CARRY OUT A NEEDS ANALYSIS WITH STUDENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BEFOREHAND. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH IS A ROBUST METHODOLOGY FOR TRIALLING INNOVATIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES BECAUSE WHEN USING THIS APPROACH, RESEARCHERS CAN BE IMME-DIATELY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICIPANTS. IMPACT ON SOCIETY AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND HIGH SELF-EFFICACY FOR USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR TEACHERS TASKED WITH DESIGNING CONTEMPORARY LEARNING ACTIVITIES IN TODAY'S HIGHER EDUCATION LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS.

"A COMPARISON OF LEARNING EXPERIENCE: SOCIAL LEARNING SYSTEMS AND E-LEARNING SYSTEMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION E-LEARNING;  ENGAGEMENT;  PARTICIPATION;  PERFORMANCE;  SOCIAL LEARNING NA DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE DIGITAL ERA, SOCIAL MEDIA ARISE AS A NEW COMMUNICATION CHANNEL THAT CAN FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION FOR EVERY USER. BASED ON THIS FACT, MANY ORGANIZATIONS TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN ADDITIONAL CHANNEL TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS. SOCIAL LEARNING IS ONE OF THE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION TO COLLABORATE WITH TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES. MANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS DECIDE TO INVOLVE SOCIAL LEARNING CONCEPT INTO THEIR TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE SHIFTING GENERATION OF STUDENT, WHICH MOST STUDENTS TODAY USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. BASED ON THIS PHENOMENON, THIS STUDY TRIED TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS BETWEEN E-LEARNING AS IN CONDITION AND SOCIAL LEARNING SYSTEM INTO LEARNING OUTCOME. IN THIS STUDY, AUTHORS DIVIDED TWO GROUPS TO TEST THE LINKAGES UNDER DIFFERENT SITUATIONS (SOCIAL LEARNING AND E-LEARNING SYSTEMS) USING SAMPLING GROUPS TO DRAW THE IMPACT OF THESE SYSTEMS.

"THE IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION BY JOURNALISM EDUCATORS [DIE BELANG VAN KRITIESE SELFREFLEKSIE DEUR JOERNALISTIEKOPVOEDERS] CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION;  JOURNALISM EDUCATION;  JOURNALISM TRAINING;  LEARNING STYLES;  REFLECTION ON JOURNALISM;  REFLECTIVE TEACHING PRACTICE;  STUDENT FEEDBACK;  TEACHING AND LEARNING;  TERTIARY JOURNALISM EDUCATION;  UNIVERSITY TEACHING NA THE JOURNALISM INDUSTRY IS CHANGING AND EVOLVING AT AN EVER-INCREASING RATE. TO KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY, JOURNALISM EDUCATION PROGRAMMES ALSO NEED TO ADAPT, OFTEN AT SHORT NOTICE (WEBB 2015). THE MAIN ARGUMENT IN THIS ARTICLE IS THAT JOURNALISM EDUCATORS SHOULD CONSIDER APPLYING THE BASIC TENETS OF CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTIVE TEACHING PRACTICE TO ENHANCE THEIR OWN TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH. IN ORDER TO EMPLOY A CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTIVE APPROACH TO TEACHING PRACTICE EDUCATORS HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BE VIGILANT ABOUT HOW THEIR OWN PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL BELIEF SYSTEMS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE WAY THEY INTERACT WITH STUDENTS (LARRIVEE 2000:294). IF ONE WANTS TO BECOME A CRITICAL REFLECTIVE EDUCATOR, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO THINK ABOUT THINGS. REFLECTION IS PROBLEM-BASED AND ACTION-ORIENTATED (LABOSKEY 2010:630). THIS WOULD MEAN THAT CRITICAL REFLECTIVE TEACHING PRACTICE SHOULD INVOLVE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LECTURE HALL. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT OF THIS OVERVIEW ARTICLE, THE WRITER FIRST DISCUSSED SOME OF THE KEY DEBATES IN JOURNALISM EDUCATION. DESPITE JOURNALISM PROGRAMMES BECOMING A STAPLE OF MANY A UNIVERSITYS EDUCATIONAL OFFERING, THERE ARE STILL DEBATES ABOUT THE INHERENT VALUE OF A JOURNALISM DEGREE (LYNCH 2015). JOURNALISM EDUCATORS ARE ALSO OFTEN AT ODDS WITH INDUSTRY ROLE-PLAYERS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY STUDENTS SHOULD BE TAUGHT (BERGER & FOOTE 2017; HERMANN 2017). FURTHERMORE, QUESTIONS ARE STILL SOMETIMES RAISED ABOUT JOURNALISM PROGRAMMES PLACE IN THE BROADER UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT (WEBB 2015). IN ADDITION, THE SLOW PACE OF CURRICULUM RENEWAL IN THE UNIVERSITY SPACE OFTEN STANDS IN THE WAY OF JOURNALISM PROGRAMMES KEEPING PACE WITH CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY (WEBB 2015; JOHNSTON 2018). TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE ARTICLES ARGUMENTS, THE WRITER HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR EDUCATORS TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE CHANGING LEARNING STYLES, HABITS AND AWARENESS OF THE STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSES. THE WRITER LISTED STUDENTS USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AS ONE AREA WHERE CRITICAL REFLECTION IS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT TEACHING MATCHES THE STUDENTS REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCES. ATTENTION WAS ALSO PAID TO THE ROLE STUDENT MOVEMENTS, SUCH AS THE #FEESMUSTFALL PROTESTS, CAN HAVE ON THE EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS WHICH FURTHER INCREASES THE NEED FOR CRITICAL REFLECTION ON THE PART OF EDUCATORS. SOME BROAD DEFINITIONS AND APPLICATIONS OF CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTIVE TEACHING PRACTICE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDED. IT WAS EMPHASISED THAT THIS APPROACH TO TEACHING MUST BE SYSTEMATIC AND INFORMED BY ACTUAL EVIDENCE. IN THE END THE AIM IS TO COME UP WITH STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESS IN A HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT (TONY & MAKURA 2015:43). BY CRITICALLY REFLECTING ABOUT TEACHING PRACTICE AN EDUCATOR IS NOT TRYING TO BECOME THE PERFECT TEACHER, BUT RATHER AIMING TO CONSTANTLY FINE-TUNE EXISTING PRACTICES AS KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE DEVELOP (ASHWIN ET AL. 2015:54). IT WAS FURTHER ARGUED THAT CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION IS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT FOR JOURNALISM EDUCATORS SINCE THEY ARE PREPARING STUDENTS FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT IS IN CONSTANT FLUX. JOURNALISTS RARELY GET TO REFLECT ABOUT THEIR OWN PRACTICES IN THE 24/7 NEWS CYCLE NEWSROOM (NIBLOCK 2007:20). THAT MAKES THE CALL FOR JOURNALISM EDUCATORS, AND SPECIFICALLY JOURNALISTS-TURNED-EDUCATORS, TO EXPERIMENT WITH AND REFLECT ABOUT THEIR TEACHING PRACTICE EVEN MORE PRESSING. IN THIS INSTANCE THE ROLE OF A UNIVERSITY IS NOT TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO, BUT RATHER TO CHALLENGE CONVENTIONAL PRACTICES (BACON 2006:148). A CASE-STUDY WAS THEN PRESENTED TO SHOW HOW HONOURS STUDENTS FEEDBACK IN THE FORM OF FOCUS GROUPS IS BEING USED TO ENCOURAGE CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION ON THE PART OF THE JOURNALISM EDUCATORS IN STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITYS POSTGRADUATE JOURNALISM DEPARTMENT. THIS EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES THE NEED FOR EDUCATORS TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE WITH STUDENTS TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO STUDENTSEXPERIENCES ON BOTH A PERSONAL AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. THE ARTICLE FINALLY CONCLUDES THAT CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION ON THE PART OF JOURNALISM EDUCATORS NOT ONLY IMPROVES TEACHING PRACTICE, BUT CAN ALSO HAVE A TELLING EFFECT ON PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISM PRACTICE. 2018 SOUTH AFRICAN ACADEMY FOR SCIENCE AND THE ARTS.

"IS THE UKRAINIAN ECONOMYS ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY APPROPRIATE TO ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH? ECONOMIC GROWTH;  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI);  HUMAN CAPITAL;  INNOVATION NA PURPOSE: DESPITE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF LITERATURE FOCUSSED ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE RESEARCH INTO FDI IN UKRAINE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INFLOWS OF FDI (IFDI) AND ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY (AC) HAS BEEN UNDER-RESEARCHED IN THE PERIPHERAL TRANSITION COUNTRIES LIKE UKRAINE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE UKRAINIAN ECONOMYS AC TO ATTRACT IFDI AND FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON AC FACTORS, SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES TO ABSORB INNOVATION AND BENEFIT FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) EXPENDITURE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY PRESENTS A THOUGHTFUL RESEARCH DESIGN: THERE IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE AC FRAMEWORK FOR JUSTIFICATION AND SELECTION FACTORS THAT ALLOWS A MEASUREMENT OF THE POTENTIAL OF UKRAINES AC TO ATTRACT AND EXPLOIT IFDI. THE STUDY USES DATA FROM 25 REGIONS IN UKRAINE FOR THE 19962015 PERIOD. TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF IFDI ON UKRAINIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH, A COBBDOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION IS USED. AS AN APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENTATION TECHNIQUE FOR DYNAMIC PANEL DATA, THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS USED TO PROVIDE UNBIASED AND EFFICIENT ESTIMATES OF THE RESULTS. THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERACTIVE TERM IN THIS STUDY ALLOWS THE AUTHORS TO INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF COMPLEMENTARITIES BETWEEN IFDI AND HUMAN CAPITAL, IN PARTICULAR WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, THAT AFFORD OPPORTUNITY TO ABSORB NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BENEFIT FROM IFDI. FINDINGS: THE RESULTING MODEL INDICATES THAT R&D EXPENDITURE BENEFITED VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IN EVOLVING COUNTRYS INNOVATION SYSTEM DUE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL HAS NOT BEEN USED EFFECTIVELY IN UKRAINE TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ATTRACT IFDI. THE NUMBER OF PATENTS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN ALL OF THE REGRESSION MODELS. MOREOVER, IFDI IN UKRAINE FOR THE 19962015 PERIOD DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. HOWEVER, THE AC OF HUMAN CAPITAL, IN PARTICULAR THOSE WITH A HIGHER EDUCATION, IS RELATIVELY RELEVANT TO BENEFIT FROM IFDI. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, WHICH SHOULD BE BASED ON IMPROVING THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, A STRATEGY FOR DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT, INNOVATION, MIGRATION, INSTITUTIONAL AND REGIONAL POLICIES AIMED AT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COUNTRYS SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD INCREASE R&D EXPENDITURE AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH AND INTRODUCE GRANTS, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORTS FOR ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TO CONTINUE UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE ORIGINALITY AND VALUE OF THIS PAPER IS EMPIRICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ENABLE A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF THE COUNTRYS ABSORPTIVE CAPABILITY REQUIRED TO BENEFIT FROM IFDI. THE PAPER ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE EXISTING ACADEMIC DEBATE AND PROVES THAT DESPITE THE WELL-ESTABLISHED THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE IFDIAC ECONOMIC IMPACT CONTEXT, A NEW THEORISATION IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THE COUNTRYS EXPLICIT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AC AND IFDI. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON EXAMINING NOT ONLY GROUPS OF COUNTRIES BUT ALSO DISTINCTLY THE COUNTRYS EXPLICIT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AC AND IFDI WITH THE PARTICULAR ATTENTION FOR THE UNDER-RESEARCHED COUNTRIES: THE PERIPHERAL TRANSITION ECONOMIES TO DISCOVER NEW RESEARCH NICHES FOR THEORY BUILDING. THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ORIGINAL METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH WITH A CAREFUL JUSTIFICATION OF THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT, AN APPROPRIATE SAMPLE AND AN ORIGINAL APPLICATION OF SEMINAL RESEARCH METHODS BASED ON THE COBBDOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION.

AS THE LIBRARY ACTS AS THE DEPOSIT CENTRE FOR THESES FROM THE ARAB WORLD UNIVERSITIES, AN EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT POLICY FOR DEPOSIT, MANAGEMENT AND ACCESS IS REQUIRED. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE EXISTING WORKFLOWS AND CONSIDERS THE CHALLENGES AND POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: INTERVIEWS (N = 8) WITH LIBRARY STAFF IN THE INFORMATION DIVISION PROVIDED DETAILS ABOUT THE METHODS USED FOR THE COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF PRINT AND ELECTRONIC THESES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF JORDAN, IN ADDITION TO SOME DIGITIZATION PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, VERY RECENT UNPUBLISHED BROCHURE WAS COLLECTED FROM ONE MEMBER OF STAFF IN THE COMPUTER APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES SECTION TO LEARN ABOUT THESES DEPOSIT STATISTICS FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE ARAB WORLD. A BUSINESS PROCESS MODELLING TECHNIQUE (RIVA) (OULD, 2005) USING ROLE ACTIVITY DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATED SOME OF THE EXISTING WORKFLOWS, THE CHALLENGES AND POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. FINDINGS: SOME ARAB UNIVERSITIES DO NOT SEND THESES ON REGULAR BASIS; SOME DO NOT COLLABORATE AT ALL. WORKFLOWS VARY ACCORDING TO THE FORMAT OF THE THESIS. THE NUMBER OF DIGITIZED PRINT THESES HAS REACHED 77,885 TITLES, OUT OF TOTAL OF 84,043, BUT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS. ALL NEWLY SUBMITTED THESES FROM JORDANIAN UNIVERSITIES COME IN PRINT AND ON A CD, BUT OTHER EXTERNAL INSTITUTIONS MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODS (CD ONLY BY MAIL, OR DIRECT UPLOADING TO THE WEBPAGE PROVIDED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF JORDAN). THE CURRENT ONLINE SYSTEM FOR UPLOADING THESES WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2017. DEPOSIT RATES THROUGH THE SYSTEM ARE VERY LOW. ACCESS TO THESES IS RELATIVELY LIMITED; PRINT THESES CAN BE ACCESSED WITHIN THE LIBRARY PREMISES. THE ONLINE THESES REPOSITORY PROVIDES FULL TEXT AND ALL ACADEMIC STAFF; STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS CAN ACCESS THESE FROM ANY WORKSTATION WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. ONLY REGISTERED USERS MAY ACCESS THESES DATABASES (READ ONLY) OUTSIDE THE NETWORK. RESOURCING FOR DIGITIZATION IS LIMITED, AND THE DIGITIZATION ITSELF IS CURRENTLY OUTSOURCED ALTHOUGH OTHER PROCESSES ARE DONE IN-HOUSE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE PAPER ENCOURAGES THE USE OF A PRACTICAL ONLINE THESES REPOSITORY TO DEPOSIT THESES FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION WITHIN THE ARAB WORLD.

"THE PRACTICE OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THROUGH SERVICE LEARNING: A TAIWANESE PERSPECTIVE COMMUNICATION PEDAGOGY;  COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT;  SERVICE LEARNING NA PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE COMMUNITY SERVICE LEARNING INITIATIVE AMONG TAIWANESE COMMUNICATION STUDENTS BY EXAMINING THE LINK BETWEEN THE VALUE OF WORK-BASED LEARNING AND LEARNING OUTCOMES FROM THE APPLIED CLASSROOM PROJECTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY INVOLVES THE APPLIED CLASSROOM PROJECTS. DATA ARE CAPTURED IN BOTH QUANTITATIVE (I.E. SURVEY) AND QUALITATIVE METHODS (I.E. REFLECTIVE PAPERS). THE SURVEY IS DESIGNED TO MEASURE GENERAL ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS OF SERVICE LEARNING STUDENTS. THE REFLECTIVE PAPERS FOCUS ON THE PARTICIPANTS EXPECTATIONS OF THE SERVICE LEARNING OUTCOME. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WORK-BASED AND SERVICE LEARNING PROJECTS ARE BENEFICIAL FOR THE STUDENTS, FACULTY, UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AS AN EXTENSION OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, STUDENTS ACQUIRE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURSE MATERIAL, GAIN PRACTICAL EXPERTISE IN THE REAL WORLD, DEVELOP INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND ENGAGE IN CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT SERVICE LEARNING ENGAGEMENTS HELP STUDENTS DEVELOP PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SINCE THE CONTENT OF TRADITIONAL LEARNING IN THE DISCIPLINE OF COMMUNICATION HAS CHANGED EXTENSIVELY OVER THE PAST DECADES (I.E. FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA TO NEW DIGITAL MEDIA), SERVICE LEARNING CAN BE A COMPLIMENTARY TOOL TO NOT ONLY BROADEN STUDENTS LEARNING, BUT TO ALSO EXPAND THEIR PROFESSIONAL HORIZONS AND OPPORTUNITIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE CURRENT STUDY EXPANDS EXISTING THEORY AND ADVANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SERVICE LEARNING IN THE DISCIPLINE OF COMMUNICATION IN A TAIWANESE CONTEXT. WITH PRACTICAL ROOTS EMBEDDED IN WESTERN EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES LINKING SERVICE LEARNING TO HIGHER EDUCATION, THIS PAPER REVEALS THAT SERVICE LEARNING DOES WORK ACROSS CULTURES AS WELL. 2018, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2018,THE PRACTICE OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THROUGH SERVICE LEARNING: A TAIWANESE PERSPECTIVE,0
"THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF ICT IN WIL: A CASE STUDY AMONG PRIESTS EXPLORING THE CORRELATION AND TRAJECTORY BETWEEN EFFECTIVE WIL AND ICT PERVASIVENESS ADULT EDUCATION;  CASE STUDY;  ICT PERVASIVENESS;  PRIESTS;  WORK INTEGRATED LEARNING NA PURPOSE: PROGRAMMES AND COURSES INTEGRATING LEARNING AND WORK, CAPTURED GENERALLY IN THIS PAPER AS WORK INTEGRATED LEARNING (WIL), USUALLY PROVIDE FLEXIBLE AND INNOVATIVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. IN A DIGITAL AGE, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) CAN BE VITAL IN DELIVERING AND ENHANCING SUCH HYBRID FORMS OF WIL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE CORRELATION AND TRAJECTORY OF ICT USE AMONG PRIESTS IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF WIL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE CASE STUDY EXPLORES ICT USE AMONG A SAMPLE OF CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIESTS BY EXAMINING INITIALLY THEIR USE OF VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS (VLES) SUCH AS BLACKBOARD AND MOODLE IN WORK-BASED LEARNING (WBL); AND ASSESSING THE TRAJECTORY AND CORRELATION TO WORK-RELATED LEARNING (WRL) THROUGH THEIR USE OF SOCIAL NETWORKING/ENGAGEMENT TOOLS SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER IN CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES (CPD). THE CORRELATION AND TRAJECTORY IS PROVIDED THROUGH A DOCUMENT ANALYSIS OF VLE ACCESS AND A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE. FINDINGS: PRIESTS IN WBL AND PRIESTS ENGAGED IN WRL (I.E. CPD COURSES) REVEALED A CORRELATION IN THE LACK OF ICT PERVASIVENESS. WITH ONLY A MINORITY OF PRIESTS ENGAGING IN FURTHER HIGHER EDUCATION (HE), THE FAMILIARITY AND USE OF ICT SUCH AS VLE PLATFORMS STAGNATED OR DECLINED. CORRELATED WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING/ENGAGEMENT, PRIESTS OVERWHELMINGLY CITED THE LACK OF TIME AS A REASON NOT TO ENGAGE WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, HOWEVER, ICT RELUCTANCE CAUSED BY FEAR WAS THE TRAJECTORY RESULTING IN A FURTHER LACK OF ICT PERVASIVENESS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: WHILE RESULTS MAY BE GENERALISABLE AMONG CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIESTS AND OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES INTERNATIONALLY, DUE TO ITS UNIQUE AND DISTINCTIVE PARAMETERS, IT IS NOT GENERALISABLE TO THE GENERAL MATURE STUDENT ADULT EDUCATION POPULATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE CASE STUDY HIGHLIGHTED THAT CONTINUED INTENTIONAL FAMILIARISATION AND USE OF ICT WITHIN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF WIL PROGRAMMES AND COURSES AMONG NON-DIGITAL NATIVES WOULD ENHANCE LEARNING. SUCH LEARNING IN WIL WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR HE PROGRAMMES ADDRESSING E-READINESS AS A PRIORITY. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: SPECIFIC TO THE SAMPLE CASE STUDY, CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND WIL, THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE CHALLENGES AND CHANGES REQUIRED FOR IMPROVED SOCIAL CAPITAL WITHIN THE FIELD OF ICT AND ADULT EDUCATION.

RECENT YEARS HAVE WITNESSED STUDENTS FACILITATING IMMERSIVE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS A CHALLENGE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LEARNING MEDIAS TO HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS. THE LACK OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE LEARNING PROCESS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL LEVEL WILL BE AFFECTED, BUT IT MAY RESULT IN THE NEED FOR EXTRA EFFORTS FROM BOTH STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS IN SOME FIELDS. IN ORDER TO ALLOW EDUCATION TO CATCH UP WITH TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS NEED TO BE UTILIZED IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE NOVEL OPTIONS TO ADD VALUE TO THE LEARNING JOURNEY. VR ENABLES STUDENTS TO DISCOVER AND EXPLORE THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE. FURTHERMORE, IT MAKES THE LEARNING PROCESS MORE INTERESTING, WHICH IMPROVES STUDENTS MOTIVATION AND ATTENTION. TO ENSURE THE ACTUAL ACTIVE USE OF VR TECHNOLOGY WHEN EMBEDDED IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, VARIOUS FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE ACCEPTANCE OR RESISTANCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION SHOULD BE EXAMINED PRIOR TO TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION: STUDENTS AND TEACHING STAFF PERCEPTIONS, INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, BARRIERS OF INTEGRATION, MOTIVATION FOR INTEGRATION, PRIOR TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCE, ETC.

BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY DATA, AN INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED FOR DHH STUDENTS WITH CONTROL AND TREATMENT GROUPS (N = 36). THE CONTROL GROUP WAS TAUGHT USING METACOGNITIVE STRATEGIES-BASED PRINTED BOOKS. BY CONTRAST, THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED AN INTERVENTION THROUGH METACOGNITIVE STRATEGIES-BASED DIGITAL BOOKS. THE PROCEDURE OF THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED THROUGH MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS: THE ACHIEVEMENT TEST OF READING COMPREHENSION WAS USED AS A BASELINE MEASUREMENT. IN ADDITION, CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS WERE USED DURING THE STUDY TO ENSURE THE FIDELITY OF TREATMENT, AND STUDENTS PERSPECTIVES WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A SURVEY AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION FOR THE SOCIAL VALIDITY PURPOSE. THE RESULTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOR BOTH GROUPS WITH THE LARGEST EFFECT RELATING TO THE TREATMENT GROUP IN READING COMPREHENSION AND ENGAGEMENT LEVEL COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP.

IN RESPONSE, I PROPOSE AUGMENTING USABILITY TESTING IN ONLINE WRITING EDUCATION WITH THE THEORIES OF DIGITAL RHETORIC. IN THE CONTEXT OF OWI, USABILITY THEORY AND DIGITAL RHETORIC SHARE A SIMILAR EMPHASIS ON THE STUDENT AS A USER OR AUDIENCE, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AT LEAST TWO KEY DIFFERENCES. FIRST, UNLIKE DIGITAL RHETORIC, USABILITY TESTING TYPICALLY ELIDES THE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF STUDENT-USERS EXPERIENCES. SECOND, THE USABILITY THEORIES OF JAKOB NIELSEN, FOR EXAMPLE, TEND TO VIEW ONLINE INTERFACES AS STATIC OBJECTS MANIPULATED BY USERS. DIGITAL RHETORIC, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEES INTERFACES AS DYNAMIC, REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY USED A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH AND ONLINE SURVEY DESIGN. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 214 POSTGRADUATE CERTIFICATE IN EDUCATION (PGCE) AND 157 BACCALAUREUS EDUCATIONIS (BED) (SENIOR AND FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING PHASE) STUDENT TEACHERS. A CLOSED STRUCTURED ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE, FLIPPED CLASSROOM PEDAGOGY QUESTIONNAIRE, DESIGNED ON A FOUR-POINT LIKERT SCALE, WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA. DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL DATA WERE COMPUTED TO EXPLORE STUDENT TEACHERS LEARNING TO TEACH AN ECONOMICS EDUCATION IN A TEACHER EDUCATION COURSE. ETHICAL CLEARANCE WAS GRANTED AND THEREFORE ADHERES TO THE POLICY ON RESEARCH ETHICS OF THE UNIVERSITY. FINDINGS: EMPIRICALLY, THE FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER REVEALED THAT THE FCP DIGITAL PEDAGOGY ENHANCED ECONOMICS STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND PERCEPTIONS IN AN ONLINE OPEN DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, STUDENT TEACHERS PERCEIVED THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE FCP EXPERIENCE AS AN ONLINE STRATEGY WAS USEFUL AND EFFECTIVE FOR THEIR LEARNING. THEREFORE, THESE FINDINGS CONFIRMED AND EXTENDED WHAT IS REVEALED BY EARLIER RESEARCH STUDIES REGARDING THE DEBATE ON THE USEFULNESS OF THE FCP APPROACH AS A POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY-INTEGRATED TEACHING DESIGN IN TEACHER EDUCATION COURSES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS INVESTIGATION COULD NOT BE GENERALISED BECAUSE A SMALL SAMPLE WAS SELECTED. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED REGARDING COMPARING OTHER SIMILAR MODULES OF THE PGCE/BED (SENIOR AND FET PHASE) PROGRAMMES OVER A LONGER INVESTIGATIVE PERIOD IN THE COLLEGE. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD BE EXPLORED, EMPLOYING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH ON HOW STUDENT TEACHERS PERCEIVED ACADEMIC SUPPORT IN THE FCP STRATEGY TOWARDS SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: ULTIMATELY, SEVERAL IMPLICATIONS FOR USING THE FCP APPROACH EMERGED, IN PARTICULAR FOR RETHINKING TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES TO SUPPORT AND ACCOMMODATE THE DIGITAL LEARNER. TO IMPLEMENT THIS APPROACH SUCCESSFULLY, FACULTIES SHOULD FORMULATE CLEAR INTENDED OUTCOMES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE FCP PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH.

IN 2016, THE VIENNA UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS BROUGHT ICM TO ITS POSTGRADUATE ECONOMICS STUDENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE AUTHORS OF THIS PAPER USED ICM TO TEACH BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS, A CORE COURSE IN THE MASTERS IN SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY WITH 49 STUDENTS, AS A PILOT FOR USING ICM IN A SUSTAINABILITY EDUCATION CONTEXT. CASE STUDY METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED TO DOCUMENT THE ICM PILOT AND DISCUSSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ICM APPROACH. DID THE STUDENT'S VIEW THE ICM FORMAT POSITIVELY? DID THE ICM FORMAT MEET THE INSTRUCTORS GOALS FOR SUSTAINABLE EDUCATION? WHICH IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES DID THE STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM OR CRITICISE? THIS CASE STUDY USED AN ANONYMOUS POST-COURSE PERCEPTION SURVEY TO DETERMINE IF THE PILOT WAS SUCCESSFUL FROM THE STUDENTS POINT OF VIEW, GRADES, AND THE AUTHORS OBSERVATIONS. THE MAIN FINDINGS ARE THAT ICM WORKED FOR SUSTAINABLE EDUCATION. STUDENTS ACQUIRED NEW KNOWLEDGE, VALUED ELEMENTS OF THE COURSE THAT WERE INTENDED FOR REFLECTION, AND EXPANDED THEIR COMPETENCIES. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE ICM FORMAT AND BELIEVED THAT IT IMPROVED THEIR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, STUDENTS ADVISED AGAINST EXPANDING THIS FORMAT.

GREAT BENEFITS IN REDUCING MEDICAL ERRORS AND ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF CLINICAL WORK HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED NURSES' SATISFACTION WITH THE USE OF PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE NURSES' SATISFACTION WITH USE OF PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS, AND TO EXPLORE THE PREDICTORS OF THIS. DESIGN: THIS IS A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY TARGETING NURSES WHO USED PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS IN A COMPREHENSIVE TERTIARY HOSPITAL IN BEIJING. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 383 NURSES WERE RECRUITED IN THIS SURVEY IN 2015. THE TOTAL SCORE OF NURSES' SATISFACTION WITH USE OF PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS WAS 238.91 (SD 39.25). NURSES WERE LESS SATISFIED WITH THE FUNCTION OF DOCUMENTATION, COMPARED WITH THE FUNCTION OF ADMINISTERING MEDICAL ORDERS. THE TIME LENGTH OF USING PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS, ACADEMIC DEGREE, AND DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS PREDICTED NURSES' SATISFACTION TOWARDS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANT USE (ALL P<0.05). CONCLUSION: NURSES WERE SATISFIED WITH THE ACCURACY OF ADMINISTERING MEDICAL ORDERS AND THE SAFETY OF RECORDING DATA. THE STABILITY OF THE WIRELESS NETWORK AND EFFICIENCY RELATED TO NURSING WORK WERE LESS PROMISING.

THE SLIDES WERE PLACED IN RANDOM ORDER, FORMING A POTPOURRI AND PRESENTED TO THE STUDENTS THROUGH A LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN) IN THE DIGITAL LABORATORY. THEY WERE ASKED TO SORT THE SLIDES AND GIVE A DIAGNOSIS FOR EACH CASE.USING GOOGLE FORMS A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PREPARED AND THIS WAS USED TO COLLECT FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS. RESULTS: MAJORITY OF STUDENTS (85%) SCORED MORE THAN 72% MARKS IN THE ACTIVITY. MARKS OBTAINED IN ARRANGING THE SLIDES DID NOT CORRELATE WITH MARKS OBTAINED IN DIAGNOSIS OF THE CASE. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL STUDENTS WHO GOT THE DIAGNOSIS RIGHT HAD FULL MARKS IN ARRANGING THE SLIDES. THE PRESENT STUDY REQUIRED STUDENTS TO RECALL AND RELATE THE FACTS WHICH THEY HAD LEARNT DURING THEIR ENTIRE YEAR, APPLY IT TO THE CASE AND GIVE A DIAGNOSIS WHICH 74% OF THEM FOUND CHALLENGING.

"RUSSIAN PERSPECTIVES OF ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF A MOOC BLENDED LEARNING;  EDUCATIONAL PROCESS;  EMPIRICAL STUDY;  HIGHER EDUCATION;  MASS OPEN ONLINE COURSES;  MODEL OF LEARNING;  MOOC;  ONLINE LEARNING NA THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID GROWTH OF MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS) IN THE GLOBAL EDUCATION MARKET IN THE LAST DECADE. ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD IN THE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION SECTOR AND IN HIGHER AND SUPPLEMENTARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. THE USE OF MOOCS IN RUSSIA TO SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL OPENS OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF EXPANDING THE EDUCATIONAL CHOICE FOR STUDENTS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL ACADEMIC MOBILITY, REDUCTION IN THE COST OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ACCESSIBILITY OF EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING DIFFERENT ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR WIDESPREAD ADOPTION, HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLORED. IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY, A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IS MADE OF THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT ONLINE LEARNING MODELS ON STUDENT EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES IN A UNIVERSITY SETTING. A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN IN WHICH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STUDENTS AT THE URAL FEDERAL UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA, WERE ENCOURAGED TO STUDY TECHNICAL AND HUMANITIES DISCIPLINES USING A FRAMEWORK OF BLENDED LEARNING, AND ONLINE LEARNING WITH TUTORING SUPPORT. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY WERE COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS OF A REFERENCE (CONTROL) GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO STUDIED THE SAME DISCIPLINES IN A TRADITIONALLY TAUGHT MODEL. IT WAS FOUND THAT BOTH MODELS (BLENDED AND ONLINE) OF MOOC IMPLEMENTATION DEMONSTRATED GREATER LEARNING GAINS, IN COMPARISON WITH THE TRADITIONAL MODEL. FOR ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL DISCIPLINES, THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLENDED OR ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES. FOR THE HUMANITIES DISCIPLINE, WHERE THE COMMUNICATIVE COMPONENT OF THE LEARNING PROCESS WAS SIGNIFICANT, THE BLENDED LEARNING TECHNOLOGY PRODUCED BETTER RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS OF THIS EMPIRICAL RESEARCH MAY BE USEFUL FOR HEADS OF EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND TEACHERS IN HELPING THEM TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS ABOUT THE MODERNIZATION OF UNIVERSITY COURSES BY INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES.

THE PAPER EXPLORES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROCUREMENT POLICY AND MECHANISMS IN A HIGHER EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENT IN ORDER TO DRIVE A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO INBOUND LOGISTICS. THERE IS LITTLE KNOWN OF THE PURCHASING BEHAVIOUR AT INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WITHIN SUCH ORGANISATIONS. A LOCALISED CITY LOGISTICS DELIVERY SERVICE PLAN, WITHIN A COHERENT CAMPUS STRATEGY FOR AN ACADEMIC CAMPUS WAS ESTABLISHED AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY, LOCATED AT THE CENTRE OF A MEDIUM SIZE BRITISH CITY. METHOD: PURCHASING DATA AND INTERVIEWS WITH THE PURCHASING MANAGER DEMONSTRATED THE CURRENT STATE OF PURCHASING PRACTICE AT THE UNIVERSITY, RELATIVE TO THE BENCHMARKS ESTABLISHED IN THE LITERATURE. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DELIVERY SERVICES, THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT, AND STAFF ATTITUDES, A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CONDUCTED WITH NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY STAFF, ADDRESSING THE PURCHASING OF ALL GOODS TO BE DELIVERED TO THE WORKPLACE. RESULT: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA, AS WELL AS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, SHOWS THAT VARIABLE FREQUENCY IN DEMAND CAN BE EXPLAINED BY: JOB TYPE; THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO RAISE A PURCHASE ORDER (PO); TYPE OF GOODS PURCHASED; EXPECTED DELIVERY TIMES; AND FROM WHERE THE PO ORIGINATES. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT TRAINING WITHIN SPECIFIC STAFF ROLES WOULD BENEFIT THE UNIVERSITYS URBAN FREIGHT COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT. WE CAN ALSO SEE THAT A VERY SMALL CORE OF PEOPLE RAISE MOST OF THE ORDERS AND THAT, THROUGH THEM, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO INFLUENCE THE MAJORITY OF ORDERS. LASTLY, DEMONSTRATING TO THE UNIVERSITYS EXECUTIVE THAT EMPLOYEE VIEWS ON PRIVATE PURCHASING DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE PRACTICE, HAS CONVINCED THE BOARD THAT CHANGING PURCHASING BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS FREIGHT EFFICIENCY IS A FEASIBLE OPTION FOR A SUSTAINABLE INSTITUTIONAL ORGANISATION. CONCLUSION: THE KEY CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER IS DEMONSTRATION OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LOGISTICS RECEIVER CAN MAKE IN DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE CITY LOGISTICS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LARGE ORGANISATION WITH MULTI-SITED AND MULTI-LEVEL MANAGEMENT (CENTRAL VS LOCAL) THAT REQUIRE MULTI-TYPE OF LOGISTICS IN A CITY-CENTRED BOUND HISTORIC BUILT ENVIRONMENT UNIVERSITY.

THE NEED OF FOLIC ACID (FA) SUPPLEMENTATION IS ESSENTIAL DURING THE PERIOD OF PREGNANCY TO PREVENT UNTOWARD EFFECTS ON PREGNANCY RELATED COMPLICATION IN MOTHER AND TO PREVENT BIRTH DEFECTS IN FOETUS. AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF FA SUPPLEMENTATION AND FA ABSENT DIETS DURING THE PREGNANCY ON MATERNAL AND THEIR OFFSPRING BODY WEIGHT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE STUDY COMPRISING OF 18 WISTAR ALBINO RATS PROCURED FROM THE ANIMAL HOUSE, MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION, KARNATAKA, INDIA, AFTER THE INSTITUTIONAL ETHICAL COMMITTEE CLEARANCE. RATS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS AND GIVEN DIFFERENT DIETS: CONTROL GROUP WITH NORMAL DIET, GROUP WITH FA SUPPLEMENTATION DIET, AND GROUP WITH FA ABSENT DIET (WITH ADDED SUCCINYL SULFATHIAZOLE) FOR FIVE WEEKS. LATER THE FEMALE ADULT WISTAR RATS COULD MATE WITH MALE RATS OF THEIR OWN STRAIN AND ALLOWED THE FEMALE TO COMPLETE THEIR PREGNANCY. AFTER THE DELIVERY, DELIVERED PUPS WERE COUNTED FOR EACH RAT AND GROSS MALFORMATION IN EACH PUP WERE NOTED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DELIVERY, ALL THE PUPS BORN TO EACH RAT WERE WEIGHED INDIVIDUALLY IN DIGITAL WEIGHING MACHINE. RESULTS: AMONG THE PREGNANT DAMS THE BODY WEIGHT GAIN WAS OBSERVED MORE IN CONTROL GROUP WITH AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 40.56 GM, FOLLOWED BY DIET WITH ABSENT FA (32 GM) AND LEAST IN RATS FED WITH FA SUPPLEMENTATION DIETS (31 GM). AVERAGE NUMBER OF PUPS BORN TO PREGNANT DAMS FED WITH FA SUPPLEMENTATION, FA ABSENT DIET, AND IN NORMAL DIET WAS FOUND TO BE 8, 8, AND 9 RESPECTIVELY. REGARDING THE BIRTH WEIGHT OF PUPS BORN TO PREGNANT DAMS FED WITH FA SUPPLEMENTATION THE AVERAGE WEIGHT WAS FOUND TO BE 6.01-5.09 GM, WITH NORMAL DIET IT WAS 5.51-5.08 GM, AND LEAST WEIGHT WAS OBSERVED IN PUPS BORN WITH FA ABSENT DIET (4.74-3.31 GM). CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE FA STATUS IN PREGNANCY IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRENATAL DEATH IN PUPS BUT IN OFFSPRINGS BORN TO MOTHERS FED WITH FA SUPPLEMENTATION, AVERAGE BODY WEIGHT WAS MORE THAN THOSE BORN TO MOTHERS FED WITH FA ABSENT DIET AND WITH CONTROL GROUPS.

THE PRESENT STUDY EMPHASISED THAT HEIS ARE IN NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE IMPACTS OF A PROGRESSIVELY DIGITAL WORLD. THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF A DIGITAL CAMPUS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AND ENLIGHTENED. FURTHERMORE, THE POSSIBLE BARRIERS AND THE WAYS TO HARNESS DIGITALISATION SUCCESSFULLY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED. THE STUDY, FINALLY, PROPOSED A DIGITAL MODEL FOR HEIS TO IMPLEMENT A DIGITAL STRATEGY FOR THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION TO REAP THE BENEFITS ATTACHED TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESSION. THE PRESENT STUDY WILL GUIDE HEIS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF DIGITAL STRATEGIC PLANS AND ASSIST IN THE ADAPTION OF THE DIGITAL CHANGE.

THEY CONSIDERED PLAGIARISM AS AN ACT OF STEALING BUT BEING UNABLE TO AVOID IN FOR THEIR STUDY. THEY TENDED TO DO PLAGIARISM BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SAVE TIME AND THEY CONSIDERED ABOUT THE PRESSURE OF THEIR STUDY. BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PARTICIPANTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE MORE EDUCATION ON PLAGIARISM AND ITS EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES ON THE ETHICS OF RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.

(EXPERT VIEW) DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES;  DIGITAL REVOLUTION;  DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY;  HIGHER EDUCATION REFORMS;  INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT;  UNIVERSITIES NA THE ONGOING DIGITAL REVOLUTION IS CHANGING THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE UNIVERSITIES EXIST AS WELL AS UNIVERSITIES THEMSELVES. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IS TO THROW LIGHT UPON SOME ASPECTS OF DIGITIZATION OF UNIVERSITIES USING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE. A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF EXPERTS (1481 EXPERTS FROM 65 RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES) WAS APPLIED AS A METHOD OF RESEARCH. THE TASK OF THE SURVEY IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT DIGITALIZATION RANKS AMONG OTHER LARGE-SCALE CHANGES AND PROBLEMS TOPICAL FOR THE MODERN UNIVERSITY; HOW DIGITAL CHALLENGE SHOULD INFLUENCE THE PRIORITIES OF UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT; TO WHAT EXTENT THE REAL PRIORITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES REFLECT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIGITAL CHALLENGE. THE SURVEY SHOWS THAT THE EXPERT COMMUNITY CONSIDERS THE TOTAL DIGITALIZATION TO BE THE LEADING TREND THAT CHANGES ECONOMY AND SOCIETY NOWADAYS. THE MAIN CHALLENGE THAT HIGHER EDUCATION WILL FACE IN THE PERIOD UNTIL 2035 WILL BE DIGITALIZATION, WHICH IS THE NEED FOR A LARGE-SCALE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION AND UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT CRITICAL SITUATIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN RUSSIA IN THE FUTURE MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF THE POSSIBLE DEGRADATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AND THE COUNTRYS DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO THE RAW MATERIALS SCENARIO. ACCELERATED TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY BASED ON DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WILL NOT BE A TRIGGER OF CRITICAL SITUATIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE FUTURE. IN THE SYSTEM OF DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES, INVESTMENT IN DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD RANK HIGH, AND WE CAN EXPECT RAPID EFFECTS OF THIS INVESTMENT. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS, PR AND PROMOTION OF THE UNIVERSITY AND COOPERATION WITH THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES RANK THE FIRST AND THE SECOND RESPECTIVELY AMONG THE ACTUAL PRIORITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNIVERSITIES; INVESTMENT IN DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN THE THIRD POSITION. THUS CERTAIN DEFORMATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE, WHICH MEANS THAT THE MAIN TREND OF CHANGES AND THE CHALLENGE FOR UNIVERSITIES IS DIGITALIZATION, BUT IN THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IT RANKS ONLY THIRD AMONG THE PRIORITIES. THE ACTUAL PRIORITY OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF INVESTMENT IS EVEN LOWER: INVESTMENT IN MOTIVATION OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS (INVESTMENT IN DYNAMIC); INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION; COOPERATION WITH BUSINESS; DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY; ATTRACTION OF NEW STUDENTS AND NEW PERSONNEL; EXPLORATORY RESEARCH; SUPPORT FOR SCIENTIFIC SCHOOLS.

FINDINGS: FOUR CLEAR THEMES EMERGED FROM THE RESPONSES COLLECTED VIA THE STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE AND PARTICULARLY FROM THE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE: WIDESPREAD USAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, DEFINITE USAGE IN BUSINESS EDUCATION, STRENGTHS OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN BUSINESS EDUCATION AND THE FLIP SIDE OF LEARNING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. ONE THING IS CERTAIN: SOCIAL MEDIA WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE INDIAN EDUCATION SECTOR. A NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN INDIA ARE INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA IN THEIR PEDAGOGY, BUT THE CHALLENGE LIES IN EFFECTIVELY ALIGNING IT WITH CURRICULUM.

FINDINGS FIVE THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA: UNCERTAINTY; EXPECTATIONS; LEARNING TO SURVIVE; SEEKING SUPPORT; AND MOVING FORWARD. FINDINGS IDENTIFY THAT THE PARTICIPANTS HAD DEVELOPED SKILLS TO SURVIVE HOWEVER CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN THEIR EXPERIENCE, INFLUENCED MOTIVATION AND BEHAVIOUR. THEY DEVELOPED THEIR OWN SKILLS OF COPING TO DEAL WITH THE DEMANDS OF ACADEMIC LIFE AND THOSE OF THE PRACTICE SETTING. AN EXPLANATORY STUDENT JOURNEY MODEL DEMONSTRATED THAT DEVELOPING SELF-EFFICACY WAS KEY TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS UNDERSTANDING THE FIRST YEAR STUDENT NURSE PERSPECTIVE AND INSIGHT INTO THEIR COPING STRATEGIES ARE KEY TO SUPPORTING A POSITIVE LEARNING JOURNEY. POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM NURSE EDUCATORS, A GROWING SENSE OF NURSING COMMUNITY AND MOTIVATION TO SUCCEED FACILITATES THEIR INTERNALISATION OF NURSING IDENTITY, NORMS AND VALUES AND AN ACTIVE PURSUIT OF LEARNING TOWARDS GRADUATE STATUS AND BECOMING A NURSE. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD",2018,THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF FIRST YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT NURSES: A HERMENEUTIC PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY,0

IN THIS PAPER, TECHNOLOGY REFERS TO 'DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY'. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: (1) EXAMINE STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY IN REGARDS TO ENJOYMENT AND PER-CEIVED USEFULNESS; (2) INVESTIGATE WHAT TOOLS AND DEVICES STUDENTS ENJOYED AND PREFERRED TO USE FOR LEARNING; (3) EXAMINE WHETHER STUDENTS PREFERRED LEARNING WITH BOOKS AND PAPER INSTEAD OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES (E.G. LAPTOPS, TABLETS, SMARTPHONES); AND (4) INVESTIGATE WHETHER STUDENT OPINIONS ABOUT DIGITAL TECH-NOLOGY AND PREFERRED LEARNING TOOLS DIFFER BETWEEN TWO UNIVERSITIES (BASED ON THEIR LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION) AND BETWEEN TWO PROGRAMS (FOUNDA-TION STUDIES AND GENERAL STUDIES). BACKGROUND PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED STUDENT DEVICE CHOICE, HOWEVER, FEWER STUDIES HAVE LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT WHICH TOOLS AND DEVICES STUDENTS CHOOSE FOR CERTAIN ACADEMIC TASKS, AND HOW THESE PREFERENCES MAY VARY ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES. METHODOLOGY IN THIS STUDY, A MIX OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA WAS GATHERED FROM 1102 PARTICIPANTS ACROSS TWO UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES FROM AN ENG-LISH-LANGUAGE FOUNDATION STUDIES PROGRAM AND A FIRST-YEAR GENERAL STUDIES PRO-GRAM. A QUESTIONNAIRE (CONTAINING CLOSED-ENDED AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS) WAS FOLLOWED BY THREE FOCUS-GROUP INTERVIEWS (N=4,3,2). ANOVA AND T-TESTS WERE USED TO TEST FOR STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE SURVEY DATA, AND QUALITA-TIVE SURVEY AND INTERVIEW DATA WERE ANALYZED FOR RECURRING THEMES. CONTRIBUTION THIS STUDY AIMS TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT OF THE LEARNING TOOLS (INCLUDING BOOKS/PAPER, LAPTOPS, TABLETS, AND PHONES) STUDENTS PREFER TO USE TO COMPLETE SPECIFIC ACADEMIC TASKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY CONTEXT. THIS STUDY ALSO SEEKS TO EVALUATE STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING, IN ORDER TO BEST IMPLEMENT AND UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF HIGHER EDU-CATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AROUND THE WORLD. FINDINGS FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS ENJOY LEARNING HOW TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGY, BELIEVE IT IMPROVES LEARNING, AND PREPARES THEM FOR FUTURE JOBS. BOOKS/PAPER WERE THE MOST PREFERRED RESOURCES FOR LEARNING, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY LAPTOPS, WHILE TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES WERE MUCH LESS PREFERRED FOR SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL TASKS. THE DATA ALSO REVEALED THAT RESPONDENTS PREFERRED LEARNING THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TRADITIONAL RESOURCES (E.G. BOOKS, PAPER) AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGI-CAL TOOLS (E.G. LAPTOPS, TABLETS). RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS THESE FINDINGS CAN BE USED TO RECOMMEND TO EDUCATORS AND HIGHER EDUCATION ADMINISTRATORS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING LEARNING OUTCOMES RELATED TO DIGITAL LITERACY IN THE CLASSROOM, TO NOT ONLY HELP STUDENTS BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE LEARNERS, BUT ALSO MORE SKILLED PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR WORKING LIVES. ADDITIONALLY, CLASSROOM PRACTICES THAT INCORPORATE BOTH TRADITIONAL TOOLS AND NEWER TECHNO-LOGICAL TOOLS FOR LEARNING MIGHT BE MOST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO FIND THE BEST LEARNING TOOL(S) FOR THE TASK. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS PARTICIPANTS PREFERRED BOOKS AND PAPER FOR LEARNING. ONE REASON WAS THAT PAPER HELPED THEM REMEMBER INFORMATION BETTER. MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE LEARNING BENEFITS OF USING MORE TACTILE MEDIUMS, SUCH AS PAPER FOR READING AND WRITING. IMPACT ON SOCIETY THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT SOME LEARNERS MAY BENEFIT MORE FROM THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THAN OTHERS. INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION FOR BOTH STU-DENTS AND FACULTY. THIS FLEXIBILITY CAN ACCOMMODATE DIFFERENT LEARNING STYLES AND PREFERENCES AND NOT ISOLATE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CLASSROOM OR WORKPLACE WHO MAY BE SLOWER TO ADAPT TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

IN THE TREND OF TRADITIONAL WAY OF EDUCATION, DISTANCE LEARNING CAME INTO EXISTENCE IN THE FORM OF CORRESPONDENCE COURSES IN THE 1890S-1920S, LATER RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCAST OF COURSES AND EARLY FORMS OF E-LEARNING. AT PRESENT DIGITAL AGE OF LEARNING IS THE HAPPENING WITH THE INCREASE IN ONLINE AND DISTANCE EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOOCS. MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS) ARE ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT TRENDS IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN RECENT YEARS. WITH TIME AND PLACE FLEXIBILITY, MOOCS GATHERS SCHOLARS AND LIKE-MINDED FELLOW LEARNERS AROUND THE GLOBE. MANY OF THE REFLECTIONS ABOUT MOOCS ARE BASED ON ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES (SCALABILITY, PRODUCTIVITY, BEING FREE) AND TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVES (SUCH AS FORUMS, PEER-TO-PEER LEARNING SUPPORT, AUTOMATIC GRADING). THE MASSIVE AND OPEN NATURE OF MOOCS PLACES THE CONTROL OF LEARNING AT THE DISCRETION OF THE LEARNER. THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND LEARNER BEHAVIOR. THIS PAPER EXAMINES AND EXPLORES THE LEARNERS BEHAVIOR RELEVANT TO MOOCS AND SUBJECTIVE CONSIDERATIONS INHERENT IN LEARNING. A NUMBER OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF MOOCS SUCH AS THE MOTIVATIONAL, EMOTIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL COMMITMENT OF MOOC LEARNERS, AND THE SKILLS PROFILE THAT EFFECTIVE MOOC LEARNERS REQUIRE ARE DISCUSSED. THEREFORE, A LITERATURE REVIEW ON MOOCS CHARACTERISTICS, TIMELINE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND A BLEND OF PRACTICAL ISSUES WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF FACULTY ON MOOCS EDUCATION ARE PRESENTED. TWO INTERESTING QUESTIONS TO ASK BASED ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE: (1) KNOWLEDGE OF MOOCS AND (2) WHO IS ATTENDING MOOCS CURRENTLY.

THE AUTHOR DEFINES SOCIAL SPACE AS A SET OF SOCIAL STATUSES AND DISTANCES. THEIR OBJECTIVE CHARACTERISTICS ARE INTERRELATED WITH SUBJECTIVE INDICATORS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUALS. THE BALANCE OF STATUSES AND DISTANCES IN SOCIETY AND THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THIS STRUCTURE FOR THE MAJORITY OF POPULATION ENSURE THE STABILITY OF SOCIETY AND EFFECTIVE SOCIAL CONTROL.

METHODS: THIS IS A LONGITUDINAL HOME-BASED, POPULATION-BASED STUDY WITH 1,197 OLDER ADULTS WHO LIVE IN THE URBAN AREA OF FLORIANPOLIS, STATE OF SANTA CATARINA, BRAZIL. WE APPLIED A FACETO- FACE INTERVIEW. WE DESCRIBE THE USE OF INTERNET ACCORDING TO FREQUENCY, PLACE, DEVICES, AND MOTIVES OF THE USE OF THE INTERNET. TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET, WE CATEGORIZED THE OUTCOME AS: NON-USE OF THE INTERNET, STOPPED USING THE INTERNET, STARTED USING THE INTERNET, AND KEPT USING THE INTERNET. THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE SEX, AGE, FAMILY INCOME, EDUCATION LEVEL, FAMILY ARRANGEMENT, MARITAL STATUS, PRESENCE OF CAREGIVER, PAID WORK, AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SCREENING. WE USED MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH RISK RATIO (RR) ESTIMATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95%CI). RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF THE USE OF INTERNET INCREASED FROM 22.9% IN 2009-2010 TO 26.6% IN 2013-2014. OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY, 7.5% STARTED USING THE INTERNET, 3.2% STOPPED USING IT, 19.1% KEPT THEIR USE, AND 70.2% KEPT THEIR NON-USE IN THE ANALYZED PERIOD. OF THE OLDER ADULTS WHO USED THE INTERNET, MOST USED IT EVERY DAY OR ALMOST EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, IN THEIR OWN HOME, ON DESKTOP OR PORTABLE COMPUTERS, MAINLY TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES, TO SEARCH FOR INFORMATION TO LEARN OR INVESTIGATE SOMETHING, TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT GOODS AND SERVICES, AND TO USE NEWS, SOCIAL NETWORKING, AND HEALTH INFORMATION WEBSITES. THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF INTERNET OVER FOUR YEARS WERE: BEING MALE (RR = 2.19, 95%CI 1.48-3.26), HIGHER MONTHLY FAMILY INCOME (RR = 3.53, 95%CI 1.35-9.23), HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL (RR = 2.64, 95%CI 1.57-4.43), AND NO PRESENCE OF CAREGIVER (RR = 0.08, 95%CI 0.02-0.31). CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THE USE OF THE INTERNET IS INCREASING AMONG OLDER ADULTS, MOST OF THE POPULATION IS STILL DIGITALLY EXCLUDED, ESPECIALLY WOMEN WITH LOWER INCOME AND EDUCATION LEVEL.

BACKGROUND ALTHOUGH VARIOUS EXPERIENCES IN THE USE OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS IN THE LITERATURE, FEWER EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DONE ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS MODEL FROM A PEDAGOGICAL STANDPOINT. THE FACTORS THAT INFLU-ENCE ITS ADOPTION HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN DEPTH, AT LEAST NOT IN A GLOBAL WAY. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND TEACHING METHODOLOGIES ACTIVE IN THE CLASSROOM, THE TREND TOWARDS INNOVATION OF TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS, AND WHETHER TEACHERS HAVE THE NECESSARY ICT TRAINING AND INFRASTRUCTURES. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF MANY EXPERIENCES IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE BEEN PUB-LISHED, THIS IS NOT SO FOR OTHER LEVELS OF EDUCATION, SUCH AS VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. METHODOLOGY A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHOD WAS USED BY CONSTRUCTING A QUESTIONNAIRE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE INCLUDED OPEN QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN QUALITATIVE INFOR-MATION, WHICH ENRICHED THE RESULTS OBTAINED. DESCRIPTIVE AND FACTOR ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE DATA, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROJECT FLIPIT!-FLIPPED CLASSROOM IN THE EUROPEAN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION"", ERASMUS+ STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP (2015-1-HU01-KA202-013555) FUNDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF HUNGARY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, AND SPAIN. THE RESEARCH SAMPLE INCLUDES 625 TEACHERS (434 FROM SPAIN, 121 FROM HUNGARY AND 61 FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC) FROM SCHOOLS PAR-TICIPATING OR SOMEHOW ASSOCIATED TO THE PROJECT. CONTRIBUTION AN EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED FRAMEWORK OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ADOPTION OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM APPROACH IN SCHOOLS WAS OBTAINED. THIS FRAMEWORK CAN GUIDE THE CURRICULUM DESIGN OF FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL COURSES FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. FINDINGS EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED FACTORS FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM IN TECH-NICAL SCHOOLS ARE PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS RESULTS FROM A SAMPLE OF 625 VOCATIONAL EDUCA-TION TEACHERS CONFIRMED THAT THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE SURVEY FULFILL THE FAC-TORS NEEDED FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION SCHOOLS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT RESULT IS THAT, ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYED TEACHERS, THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM IS A STRONGLY PRACTICE-ORIENTED METHOD VERY SUITABLE FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS THE FRAMEWORK HERE PRESENTED CAN GUIDE THE CURRICULUM DESIGN OF FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL COURSES FOR VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND ALLOW SCHOOLS TO KNOW THE FACTORS TO REVIEW AND IMPROVE IN ORDER TO USE THE MODEL. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS THIS STUDY IS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DETERMINING THE FACTORS NEEDED FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL IN VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. MORE STUD-IES USING ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCES AND METHODS ARE NEEDED TO OBTAIN A DEFINITE MODEL TO SUPPORT THIS ADOPTION SINCE FC HAS PROVED TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR MOTIVATING STUDENTS. WE HOPE THESE RESULTS PAVE THE WAY FOR SCHOOLS WHO WANT TO ADOPT THE FC MODEL AND FOR FOCUSING TEACHING TRAINING ON THE COMPETENCES THAT THIS WORK DETECTED. IMPACT ON SOCIETY RECENTLY, WE ARE WITNESSING AN IMPORTANT DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION AT EVERY LEVEL. DIFFERENT INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES HAVE EMERGED IN A SEARCH FOR MORE MOTIVATING AND EFFECTIVE WAYS TO LEARN, AS WELL AS TO DEVELOP IN OUR STU-DENTS THE SO-CALLED 21ST-CENTURY SKILLS SUCH AS CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, CREATIVITY, AND INFORMATION, MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY SKILLS. THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM APPROACH CAN HELP TO IMPROVE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BY CHANG-ING TRADITIONAL CLASSES AND TEACHING STUDENTS OTHER IMPORTANT SOFT SKILLS, SUCH AS TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION, REFLECTION, DIGITAL SKILLS, AND SELF-STUDY. FUTURE RESEARCH THE MODEL IS CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN SCHOOLS IN SPAIN, HUNGARY, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC USING THE RESULTS OBTAINED HERE UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT ""FLIPIT!-FLIPPED CLASSROOM IN THE EUROPEAN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION"", ERASMUS+ STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP (2015-1-HU01-KA202-013555).

THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER COMES FROM A LARGER PROJECT CALLED STEWARDING AND POWER IN DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES (SPIDER) AND WE DESCRIBE HOW THE MIXING OF CAMPUS BASED AND DISTANCE STUDENTS HAS BEEN USED TO ENHANCE INFORMED LEARNING WITHIN A POSTGRADUATE DEGREE UNIT. THE ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION IS TO INVESTIGATE THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF ALTERITY (LINELL, 2009) ON THE EXPERIENCE OF VARIATION. ONLINE GROUP TASKS MIXED CAMPUS AND DISTANCE STUDENTS TOGETHER AND WE STUDIED THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT STUDENTS USED INFORMATION TO LEARN. EVIDENCE FROM DISCUSSION BOARD POSTS SUPPORTS OUR CLAIMS THAT DISCUSSION BOARD ACTIVITIES ENABLE DIALOGUES AND THAT DIVERSITY WITHIN THE LEARNING COMMUNITY ENHANCES LEARNING THROUGH ALTERITY. WE CONCLUDE THAT ONLINE LEARNING HAS MUCH TO OFFER INFORMATION LITERACY EDUCATION, WHETHER USED ALONE OR WHEN CAMPUS BASED AND DISTANCE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN ONLINE TASKS TO DO TOGETHER. THIS PAPER BRINGS NEW INSIGHT TO THE FIELD OF INFORMATION LITERACY EDUCATION BY SHOWING HOW DISTANCE LEARNING BRINGS A DISTINCT QUALITY TO INFORMATION LITERACY PEDAGOGY, AS IT PROVIDES SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNERS TO TEACH EACH OTHER AND THEN MAKE CRITICALLY-INFORMED JUDGEMENTS ABOUT CONTEXTS, INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY WITH WHICH THEY ARE UNFAMILIAR.

MULTICULTURAL AND DIVERSITY TRAINING ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT IN MAKING STRUCTURAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES LEADING TO EQUITY, THEREFORE, A NEW FORM OF CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS IS NEEDED TO TRAIN DIVERSE SCIENTISTS WITH NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS, METHODS, AND PERSPECTIVES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE LEADING TO DIVERSITY (BUILD); PROMOTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSITY IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH (PODER), WHICH IS AN UNDERGRADUATE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM BASED ON TRANSFORMATIVE FRAMEWORK ROOTED IN CRITICAL RACE THEORY (CRT). KEY HIGHLIGHTS: BY EMPLOYING A CRT-INFORMED CURRICULUM AND TRAINING IN BUILD PODER, STUDENTS ARE EMPOWERED NOT ONLY TO GAIN ACCESS BUT ALSO TO THRIVE IN GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND BEYOND. PODER MEANS ""POWER"" OR ""TO BE ABLE TO"" IN SPANISH. ESSENTIALLY, WE ARE ""BUILDING POWER"" USING STUDENTS' STRENGTHS AND EMPOWERING THEM AS LEARNERS. THE NEW CURRICULUM HELPS STUDENTS UNDERSTAND INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT MAY PREVENT THEM FROM PERSISTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION, LEARN TO BECOME THEIR OWN ADVOCATES, AND SUCCESSFULLY CONFRONT SOCIAL BARRIERS AND INSTANCES OF INEQUITIES AND DISCRIMINATION. TO CHALLENGE THESE BARRIERS AND SUSTAIN CAMPUS CHANGES IN SUPPORT OF STUDENTS, BUILD PODER WORKS TOWARD CHANGING CAMPUS CULTURE AND RESEARCH MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS. BY JOINING WITH ONGOING UNIVERSITY STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRADUATION INITIATIVE, WE INCLUDE CRT TENETS INTO THE CAMPUS DIALOGUE AND STIMULATE CAMPUS-WIDE DISCUSSIONS AROUND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. STRONG TIES WITH FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS ALSO ENRICH BUILD PODER'S STUDENT BODY AND STRENGTHEN MENTOR DIVERSITY.

"STUDENTS' AND LECTURERS' VIEWS ON MATHEMATICS RESOURCES NA NA THERE IS A GENERAL AGREEMENT THATMANY STUDENTS STRUGGLEWITH THE TRANSITION FROMSECONDARY TO HIGHER EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF MATHEMATICS MODULES. LECTURERS OFTEN SUGGEST OR SUPPLY SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES TO GIVE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVERCOME THEIR DIFFICULTIES. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS OFTEN SEEK OUT RESOURCES INDEPENDENTLY, MANY OF WHICH ARE PROVIDED THROUGH DIGITAL-AGE TECHNOLOGY. CURRENT RESEARCH IN THIS AREA FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RESOURCES THAT MATHEMATICS EDUCATORS HAVE DEVELOPED. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHICH RESOURCE TYPES STUDENTS SELECT THEMSELVES AND WHAT SPECIFIC CONTENT THEY SEEK. IN ADDITION, THE TYPE OF RESOURCES THAT LECTURERS RECOMMEND TO STUDENTS IS NOT WELL DOCUMENTED.

RECENTLY, THE QUESTION ARISES ABOUT HOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIES TAKING PLACE DURING THE AFOREMENTIONED PROCESS COULD BE MADE EASIER BY USING TECHNOLOGIES. IN AN EFFORT TO KNOW WHETHER UNIVERSITY STUDENTS REALLY USE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO PLAN, ORGANIZE AND FACILITATE THEIR OWN LEARNING, WE HAVE PROPOSED THREE RESEARCH QUESTIONS. WHICH TECHNOLOGIES DO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS USE TO SELF-REGULATE THEIR LEARNING? WHAT SELF-REGULATED LEARNING STRATEGIES DO THEY DEVELOP USING TECHNOLOGIES? WHAT PROFILES COULD BE IDENTIFIED AMONG STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR USE OF SELF-REGULATION STRATEGIES WITH TECHNOLOGY? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, THE SURVEY OF SELF-REGULATED LEARNING WITH TECHNOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS DESIGNED. INFORMATION FROM A SAMPLE GROUP WITH 711 STUDENTS FROM VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES LOCATED IN THE REGION OF ANDALUSIA (SPAIN) WAS COLLECTED WITH THIS SURVEY. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FREQUENT USERS OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, THEY TEND NOT TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO REGULATE THEIR OWN LEARNING PROCESS. OF ALL TECHNOLOGIES ANALYSED, INTERNET INFORMATION SEARCH AND INSTANT COMMUNICATION TOOLS ARE USED CONTINUALLY. IN TURN, THE MOST GENERALISED SELF-REGULATION LEARNING STRATEGIES ARE THOSE RELATIVE TO SOCIAL SUPPORT. NEVERTHELESS, STUDENTS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER REGARDING THEIR USE AND FREQUENCY.

THE QUALITY OF THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT CAN BE ASSESSED, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM STUDENTS LEVELS OF SATISFACTION. IN THIS STUDY A SATISFACTION IS PROPOSED BY FOLLOWING ASPECTS: INSTRUCTION AND FEEDBACK, PEDAGOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL METHODS, PERCEIVED ENJOYMENT AND SELF-MOTIVATION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE STUDENTS SATISFACTION WITH A UBIQUITOUS LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON 360OTECHNOLOGY AND A TRADITIONAL WEB-BASED ONLINE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. A COMPARATIVE, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN WAS USED. 115 STUDENTS ASSIGNED ON CLINICAL HISTOLOGY AND HISTOTECHNOLOGY COURSE AND VOLUNTARILY TO THE STUDY, 61 STUDENTS WERE ASSIGNED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 54 TO A CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP STUDIED VIA A 360OUBIQUITOUS LEARNING ENVIRONMENT (ULE) AND THE CONTROL GROUP VIA A WEB-BASED ONLINE COURSE (WLE).

OBJECTIVE: TO GUIDE TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT IN THIS NEW PLATFORM AND TO EVALUATE DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO SMARTPHONE-DELIVERED INTERVENTIONS, WE EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS OF SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP WITH DEMOGRAPHICS, TOBACCO USE AND THOUGHTS ABOUT QUITTING, OTHER HEALTH BEHAVIORS, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, HEALTH CARE ACCESS, AND INTERNET AND TECHNOLOGY UTILIZATION USING A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF US ADULT SMOKERS. METHODS: DATA WERE FROM THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE'S 2014 HEALTH INFORMATION NATIONAL TRENDS SURVEY 4 (HINTS 4), CYCLE 4. THIS MAILED SURVEY TARGETED NONINSTITUTIONALIZED INDIVIDUALS AGED 18 YEARS OR OLDER USING TWO-STAGE STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING. FOR THIS ANALYSIS, WE RESTRICTED THE SAMPLE TO CURRENT SMOKERS WITH COMPLETE DATA ON SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP (N=479). RESULTS: NEARLY TWO-THIRDS (WEIGHTED PERCENT=63.8%, 248/479) OF SMOKERS REPORTED OWNING A SMARTPHONE. THOSE WHO WERE YOUNGER (P<.001), EMPLOYED (P=.002), NEVER MARRIED (P=.002), AND HAD HIGHER EDUCATION (P=.002) AND INCOME (P<.001) HAD THE HIGHEST RATES OF OWNERSHIP. SMARTPHONE OWNERS DID NOT DIFFER FROM NONOWNERS ON FREQUENCY OF SMOKING, RECENT QUIT ATTEMPTS, OR FUTURE PLANS TO QUIT SMOKING, ALTHOUGH THEY REPORTED GREATER BELIEF IN THE BENEFITS OF QUITTING (P=.04). DESPITE BEING EQUALLY LIKELY TO BE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, SMARTPHONE OWNERS REPORTED GREATER FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION (P=.03) AND WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT PAST-YEAR EFFORTS TO INCREASE EXERCISE (P=.001) AND TO LOSE WEIGHT (P=.02). NO DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION WERE FOUND. SMARTPHONE OWNERS REPORTED BETTER PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN SEVERAL DOMAINS AND HIGHER ACCESS TO AND UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET, INCLUDING FOR HEALTH REASONS. CONCLUSIONS: SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP AMONG SMOKERS MIRRORS MANY TRENDS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, INCLUDING THE OVERALL RATE OF OWNERSHIP AND THE ASSOCIATION WITH YOUNGER AGE AND HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. APPS FOR SMOKING CESSATION COULD POTENTIALLY CAPITALIZE ON SMARTPHONE OWNERS' EFFORTS AT MULTIPLE HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGES AND INTEREST IN COMMUNICATING WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS VIA TECHNOLOGY.

A CORRELATIONAL DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS USED, WITH A SAMPLE OF 19 PORTALS, WITH A JOURNALISTIC VOCATION OR PURPOSE. THE OBSERVATION WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN A COMPOSED WEEK, DURING THE FIRST MONTHS OF 2014; THAT IS, WE TOOK ONE DAY EACH WEEK DURING SEVEN WEEKS TO OBSERVE THE MEDIA, SO THE FIRST WEEK WAS OBSERVED ON MONDAY, THE NEXT WEEK ON TUESDAY, AND SO ON CONSECUTIVELY UP TO COMPLETE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. RESULTS: IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY FOUR INTERACTIVITY STRATEGIES THAT SHOULD BE USED IN HIGHER EDUCATION, SINCE THEY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE CURRENT STUDENTS. CONCLUSIONS: IN ORDER FOR TEACHERS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS, THEY MUST DO WHAT THE NEW MEDIA DO: LISTEN TO THEIR AUDIENCE; THAT IS, THEIR STUDENTS. 2017, EDITORIAL CIENCIAS MEDICAS.

THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO: EXPLORE THE NATURE OF ADOLESCENT RISK TAKING ONLINE BEHAVIOUR FROM A GROUP OF YOUNG ADULTS IN DIFFERENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; DEVELOP TYPES OF ONLINE RISK PROFILES; EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF HELP-SEEKING AND TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL REAL WORLD HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. METHOD: A SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND AND ITALY OF 18 TO 25 YEAR OLDS IN HIGHER EDUCATION, ASKING THEM ABOUT THEIR ONLINE EXPERIENCES BETWEEN THE AGES OF 12 AND 16. RISKY BEHAVIOUR ON AND OFF-LINE, TYPES OF VICTIMISATION (ON AND OFFLINE) AND SEXUAL SOLICITATION REQUESTS ONLINE WERE ANALYSED TOGETHER WITH HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR. RESULTS: FOUR PROFILES CONCERNING ADOLESCENT RISKY BEHAVIOURS WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS. EACH WERE DISTINGUISHABLE BY A PATTERN OF LATENT CONSTRUCTS LINKED TO RISK OFFLINE AND ONLINE. TWO WERE CONSIDERED NORMATIVE (ADAPTED ADOLESCENTS AND INQUISITIVE ONLINE) AND TWO HIGH RISK (RISK-TAKING AGGRESSIVE AND SEXUALLY INQUISITIVE ONLINE). ADDITIONALLY, REGRESSION ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT FACTORS LINKED TO PREDICTING BOTH LIKELIHOOD OF MEETING AN ADULT FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES, AND HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROFILES DEVELOPED ARE A USEFUL TOOL FOR EDUCATORS, POLICE AND HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE PRACTITIONERS IN IDENTIFYING ADOLESCENTS AT RISK IN ORDER TO UNDERTAKE PREVENTATIVE WORK.

"DIGITALIZATION OF LEARNING RESOURCES IN A HEI A LEAN MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE CASE STUDIES;  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT;  HIGHER EDUCATION;  LEAN PRODUCTION NA PURPOSE: LEAN IS CONSIDERED AS A MAJOR MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR IMPROVING OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE. IT IS A SYSTEMIC PHILOSOPHY THAT EMPHASIZES ON FULFILLING CUSTOMER NEEDS, WASTE MINIMIZATION, AND A COMMITMENT TO A CULTURE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. IN RECENT YEARS, MANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (HEIS) HAVE LEVERAGED ON THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN LEARNING AND JUST-IN-TIME TRAINING FOR LEARNERS IN THE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BOTH THE INTERNAL PROCESSES OF COURSE DELIVERY AND ENHANCE THE PROVISIONS OF EDUCATION QUALITY. IN RECOGNIZING THESE TRENDS IN HEIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY FACTORS THAT FACILITATE THE CONVERSION OF PRINTED LEARNING RESOURCES TO E-LEARNING RESOURCES IN A HEI. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY USED A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY APPROACH AND EXAMINED A UNIQUE CASE OF A HEI THAT IS UNDERGOING THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS FROM PRINTED LEARNING RESOURCES TO DIGITAL SOURCES TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN EDUCATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY AND OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY. DATA SOURCES INCLUDE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PERSONNEL DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT OF CONVERTING PRINTED LEARNING RESOURCES TO DIGITAL SOURCES, NOTES TAKEN FROM INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS, AND SECONDARY DATA SUCH AS MINUTES OF MEETINGS, LEARNING RESOURCE ARCHIVES, AND RELEVANT LITERATURE. A RETROSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE WAS ADOPTED IN THE CASE ANALYSIS SINCE THE HEI HAS ALREADY COMPLETED 50 PERCENT OF THE CONVERSION PHASE WHEN THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT. FINDINGS: ABDUCTIVE REASONING APPROACH AND WELL-ESTABLISHED LEAN PRINCIPLES WERE USED TO MAKE SENSE OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROCESS OF THE HEI. BASED ON THE RETROSPECTIVE CASE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS FOUND EVIDENCE THAT CHARACTERIZES LEAN MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND IDENTIFIES THE CRITICAL FACTORS (CFS) THAT HAVE FACILITATED THE HEI TO ACHIEVE THE KEY MILESTONES IN THE CONVERSION JOURNEY. THESE INCLUDE COMMON VISION, TOP MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP, TIMELY INFORMATION SHARING, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: SINCE THIS RESEARCH IS AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY, THE RESULTS OBTAINED CANNOT BE GENERALIZED. FUTURE RESEARCH CAN BE CONDUCTED TO PROVIDE AN IMPACT ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS OF A SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYS ONLY THE USE OF E-STUDY MATERIALS.

IT ALSO AIMS TO EXAMINE THE LEARNING ORGANISATION (LO) ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INITIATIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS IS A LONGITUDINAL CASE STUDY BASED ON INTERVIEWS AND REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS, AND REVIEWED USING THREE MODELS DRAWN FROM THE LITERATURE: BREAKING THE IRON TRIANGLE (CONTAINING COSTS; WIDENING ACCESS; ENHANCING QUALITY); A TAILORED VERSION OF DISTANCE EDUCATION APPROPRIATE FOR RESEARCH-INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES; A STRATEGY FOR SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. FINDINGS: ENTREPRENEURIALISM YIELDED GROWTH (PLE STUDENT NUMBERS WENT FROM 150 TO 2,000 IN 15 YEARS) AND DIVERSIFICATION (TWO NEW PROGRAMMES ESTABLISHED). THE PLE PROGRAMME ADVANCED IN TWO WAVES: THE FIRST CENTRED ON WIDENING ACCESS AND THE SECOND, ON ENHANCING QUALITY. COSTS WERE CONTAINED. BOTH THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF LO ATTRIBUTES ARE IDENTIFIED AT THREE DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONAL LEVELS.

REFLECTION ON PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK IS INCORPORATED, AND SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO HOW THE DESIGN OF SIP EQUIPS STUDENTS WITH THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SOLVE SUSTAINABLE CHALLENGES. FINDINGS: FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THAT DESPITE HIGH ENGAGEMENT IN THE SIP ONLINE DISCUSSION FORUMS, THERE WAS A DESIRE TO GO BEYOND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION; STUDENTS WANTED TO GET ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES. SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGE DAYS ARE THEREFORE NOW OFFERED AND COMPRISE IN-PERSON DISCUSSION, VOLUNTEERING AND COLLABORATIVE GROUP LEARNING TO COMPLEMENT THE ONLINE COURSE. THIS PRACTICE ELEMENT AS WELL AS THE CROWDSOURCING OF SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS WITHIN SIP ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN THIS PAPER.

"CLICKERS AND FORMATIVE FEEDBACK AT UNIVERSITY LECTURES CLICKERS;  FEEDBACK;  FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT;  HIGHER EDUCATION;  LECTURES;  STUDENT RESPONSE SYSTEMS NA LECTURING IS OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING A MONOLOGICAL AND STUDENT PASSIVE WAY OF TEACHING. HOWEVER, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS STUDENT RESPONSE SYSTEMS (SRS) CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT THE TRADITIONAL LECTURING FORMAT. DURING A SERIES OF FIVE TWO-HOUR LECTURES IN QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR FIRST YEAR PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS, WE USED SRS TO CONDUCT 46 INTERVENTIONS PER LECTURE. IN EACH INTERVENTION, THE STUDENTS WERE ASKED A SUBJECT-RELATED QUESTION, DISCUSSED POSSIBLE ANSWER WITH PEERS AND ANSWERED INDIVIDUALLY USING A HANDHELD REMOTE CONTROL (A CLICKER). THE STUDENT ANSWERS WERE THEN DISPLAYED IN HISTOGRAM AND FOLLOWED UP BY THE LECTURER IN SITU. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO FIND OUT WHETHER STUDENTS EXPERIENCED RECEIVING FORMATIVE FEEDBACK SUPPORTING THEIR SELF-MONITORING FROM THESE INTERVENTIONS, AND HOW THE FEEDBACK WAS PERCEIVED. USING A MIXED METHODS RESEARCH DESIGN, DATA WERE COLLECTED IN A LIVE SURVEY AT THE LAST LECTURE (N: 173) AND THREE FOCUS GROUPS AFTER THE LECTURE SERIES (N1: 6, N2: 6, N3: 2). OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT MOST STUDENTS EXPERIENCED RECEIVING FORMATIVE FEEDBACK SUPPORTING THEIR SELF-MONITORING FROM THE INTERVENTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THEY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THEIR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT MATTER (FEEDBACK), WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO LEARN IN THE SUBJECT (FEED UP) AND WHAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON FURTHER (FEED FORWARD). ALTHOUGH ABOUT 90% OF THE STUDENTS EXPERIENCED RECEIVING FORMATIVE FEEDBACK FROM SOME PART OF THE INTERVENTION, ONLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE HALF OF THE STUDENT GROUP PERCEIVED THE PEER DISCUSSIONS AS USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE FOCUS GROUPS RELATED THIS TO THE STUDENTS NOT ALWAYS HAVING PEERS TO DISCUSS WITH AND VARIATIONS IN THE QUALITY OF THE DISCUSSIONS. 2015, THE AUTHOR(S).",2017,CLICKERS AND FORMATIVE FEEDBACK AT UNIVERSITY LECTURES,0

"EFFECT OF VISUAL FEEDBACK ON THE STATIC AND KINEMATIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HANDWRITING DIGITAL HANDWRITING;  FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE HANDWRITING;  KINEMATICS;  SIGNATURES;  VISUAL FEEDBACK NA RESEARCH ON VISUAL FEEDBACK HAS NOT PRODUCED CONSISTENT RESULTS TO SHOW HOW VISUAL FEEDBACK OR THE LACK, THEREOF, INFLUENCES INDIVIDUAL HANDWRITING CHARACTERISTICS. A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE DEGREE OF THIS INFLUENCE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, SAMPLES OF SIGNATURES AS WELL AS CURSIVE AND BLOCK TEXT, WRITTEN WITH AND WITHOUT VISUAL FEEDBACK, WERE COLLECTED FROM 40 VOLUNTEERS AND IMPORTED INTO A PC VIA A PEN TABLET, USING AN ELECTRONIC INKING PEN. THE DATA WAS ANALYZED IN A HANDWRITING MOVEMENT ANALYSIS SOFTWARE MODULE SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THIS RESEARCH THAT WAS ADDED TO THE SOFTWARE MOVALYZER BY NEUROSCRIPT LLC. TWO FORENSIC DOCUMENT EXAMINERS (FDES) INDEPENDENTLY ANALYZED SAMPLES FROM THE TWO GROUPS (SAMPLES EXECUTED WITH NORMAL VISUAL FEEDBACK VERSUS THE GROUP OF SAMPLES EXECUTED WITHOUT VISUAL FEEDBACK). THEY FOUND NO FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS. THEIR ANALYSES ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILARITIES EXISTED IN THE GENERAL DESIGN OF THE ALLOGRAPHS (ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF A LETTER OR OTHER GRAPHEME) AND IN THE PICTORIAL ASPECTS, REGARDLESS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SAMPLES. IN THE CURSIVE AND BLOCK HANDWRITING, FOUR MAIN QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS WERE LINKED TO THE ABSENCE OF VISUAL FEEDBACK: CHANGE OF OVERALL SIZE, NON-UNIFORMITY OF LEFT MARGINS, CHANGE OF BASELINE ALIGNMENT, AND INCLUSION OF EXTRA TRAJECTORIES. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS VERIFIED THE ABOVE FINDINGS. THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT GENDER, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL (ABOVE HIGH SCHOOL) AND HANDEDNESS CREATE AN INSIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WRITING PRODUCED WITH AND WITHOUT VISUAL FEEDBACK. THE ONLY NOTABLE EXCEPTION IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIGNATURE DURATION AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. THE VOLUNTEERS WITH A MEDIUM EDUCATION LEVEL SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DURATION WHILE SIGNING THEIR NAMES WITHOUT VISUAL FEEDBACK IN COMPARISON TO THOSE WITH HIGHER EDUCATION LEVELS. THE COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS SUGGESTS THAT HANDWRITING IS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY INFLUENCED BY VISUAL FEEDBACK. 2017, ASSOCIATION OF FORENSIC DOCUMENT EXAMINERS.

"WORK-BASED LEARNING FOR THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES: A CASE STUDY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF BA (HONS) WEB DESIGN AND SOCIAL MEDIA CREATIVE CAREERS;  DEGREE APPRENTICESHIPS;  HIGHER APPRENTICESHIPS;  WEB MEDIA PRODUCTION NA PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT GAINED BUILDING A WORK-BASED LEARNING (WBL) DEGREE APPRENTICESHIP DEVELOPED THROUGH THE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING COUNCIL FOR ENGLAND CATALYST FUND. REQUIREMENTS OF THE FUNDING STIPULATED THAT, IN ADDITION TO WORK WBL PROVISION, THE COURSE SHOULD BE OFFERED AS A TWO-YEAR FAST-TRACK. THIS WAS REQUIRED TO HELP REDUCE THE INCREASED FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED ON STUDENTS, WHICH AROSE FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN HE TUITION FEES SANCTIONED BY THE UK COALITION GOVERNMENT IN 2010. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER PRESENTS A CASE STUDY DETAILING THE ADVANTAGES AND PITFALLS OF INTEGRATING WBL INTO FLEDGLING BUT RAPIDLY EXPANDING CREATIVE INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS WEB MEDIA PRODUCTION AND SOCIALMEDIA. THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMPOSITION OF WBLMODEL WAS ADAPTED FROM AN EXISTING AND SUCCESSFUL THREE YEAR, TRADITIONALLY STRUCTURED, BA (HONS) WEB MEDIA PRODUCTION COURSE. IT ADOPTED A MODEL WHEREBY PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN EXTERNAL ORGANISATIONS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE ESTABLISHED THROUGH A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT. FINDINGS - GROWTH OF THE WEB MEDIA SECTOR, WHILE RAPID, IS STILL EMBRYONIC. CONSEQUENTLY MANY EMPLOYERS, PARTICULARLY IN SOCIAL MEDIA, REMAIN SMALL OR MICRO BUSINESSES, MANY CAPABLE OF ONLY EMPLOYING ONE STUDENT. THIS CAUSED SEVERAL ACCUMULATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND ISSUES ALONG WITH FUNDING IMPLICATIONS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING A SURVEY METHOD, THIS STUDY ATTEMPTED TO EXPLORE A STRATEGIC-BASED MEASURE FOR IMPROVING ACADEMIC LAW LIBRARIES IN KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 43 RESPONDENTS THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, INCLUDING LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS, ACADEMICIANS AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS OF THE AFFILIATION AWARDING INSTITUTIONS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE LAW COLLEGES. FINDINGS: BASED ON THE INTERVIEW FINDINGS, THE STUDY FOUND THAT MOST OF THE LAW COLLEGES DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES. OUTDATED COLLECTIONS, SCARCITY OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND BUDGETARY ISSUES, INACTIVE ROLES OF REGULATING BODIES AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, LIMITED ROLES OF PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY STAFF, LIMITED ACCESS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION DIGITAL LIBRARY, ABSENCE OF PROPER LIBRARY SETUP AND MORAL OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF INSTITUTIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACADEMIC LAW LIBRARIES WERE THE MAIN CHALLENGES.

THE STUDY ALSO LOOKS AT DIFFERENCES IN THE USE PATTERNS ACROSS 12 DISCIPLINES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE ACADEMICS' USE PATTERNS OF SCHOLARLY E-JOURNALS IN 12 DISCIPLINES. THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PUNJAB WAS USED FOR THE SAMPLE POPULATION. SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL REGULAR AND CONTRACTUAL ACADEMICS OF LAHORE CAMPUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY. AFTER FOLLOW UP, 457 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RECEIVED WITH A RESPONSE RATE OF 54 PER CENT. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICS WERE USED TO ANALYSE DATA. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ACADEMICS MADE MORE FREQUENT USE OF E-JOURNALS, ONLINE REFERENCE SOURCES AND DISCUSSION WITH COLLEAGUES FOR SCHOLARLY ACTIVITIES. E-JOURNALS WERE USED PREDOMINANTLY FOR RESEARCH-RELATED ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN FOR TEACHING AND INSTRUCTION. ACADEMICS OBTAINED E-JOURNAL ARTICLES PRIMARILY FROM OPEN ACCESS SOURCES, I.E. GENERAL SEARCH ENGINES AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR AS COMPARED TO SUBSCRIBED AND OTHER SOURCES OF E-JOURNAL ARTICLES. DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCES WERE ALSO FOUND IN ACADEMICS' USE PATTERNS OF E-JOURNALS.

"FROM I TO WE: COLLABORATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AND LEARNING? COLLABORATIVE;  COURSE DESIGN;  ENTREPRENEURSHIP;  HIGHER EDUCATION;  LEARNING;  STUDENTS PERCEPTION NA PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASK: WHAT EFFECT DOES MOVING FROM INDIVIDUAL TO COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE ENTREPRENEUR IN ENTERPRISING EDUCATION HAVE ON THE STUDENTS LEARNING? AND GIVEN THIS SHIFT IN UNDERSTANDING, IS THERE A NEED FOR A NEW PARADIGM IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP LEARNING? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS PAPER DRAWS ON ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA FROM ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION (EED) AT A SUMMER SCHOOL IN DENMARK. THE PURPOSE OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL WAS TO BRING THE STUDENTS FROM AN AWARENESS OF THEIR OWN COMPETENCES TO A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF RESOURCES, RELATIONSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BECOMING ENTERPRISING. FINDINGS: DRAWING ON THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN UNDERSTANDING CREATIVITY, THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN BECOMING AN ENTREPRENEUR IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHERS AND BEING CREATIVE IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHERS. THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT A FOCUS ON THE COLLABORATIVE AND DISTRIBUTED CHARACTER OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AS WITHIN THE WE-PARADIGM FROM CREATIVITY, DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE IMPORTANCE OF PERCEPTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS SELF-IMAGES AS PART OF A COURSE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. YET, A REFORMULATION OF THESE COULD BE AN ENTRY POINT FOR RICHER GROUP WORK AND ARTICULATION OF DIVERSE GROUP POTENTIAL. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE STEP FURTHER IN WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED DURING AN EED COURSE. RATHER THAN REMAIN A FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL LEARNING AND TREATING GROUP WORK A DIDACTICS INSTRUMENT, TEAM FORMATION PROCESSES CAN BE USED AS A PEDAGOGY/ANDRAGOGY EXPERIENTIAL TOOL IN THE CLASSROOM WITH ITS OWN LEARNING OUTCOMES, AS PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED ABOVE. FOR EDUCATORS, THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL TO AID THE COMPLICATED TASK OF BRINGING EED TO STUDENTS ACROSS CAMPUS. FOR STUDENTS, THIS NEW APPROACH MEANS THAT THE OFTEN DREADED AND FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF CLASSROOM TEAM FORMATION CAN BECOME A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF PURPOSEFUL TEAM ASSEMBLY AND COLLABORATION. TWO POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER CAN BE IDENTIFIED: FOR STUDENTS WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN FORMING TEAMS AND WORKING IN GROUPS, TAKING THEM THROUGH THIS PROCESS MAY NOT HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT AS THEY MAY RELY ON HABITS AND KNOWN MECHANISM WITHOUT MUCH REFLECTION; IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED EFFECT WITH STUDENTS THAT KNOW EACH OTHER WELL BEFORE THE COURSE STARTS, AS THEY MAY HAVE TOO STRONG HIDDEN AGENDAS ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO WORK WITH AND WHO THEY DO NOT WANT TO WORK WITH THAT THIS WILL OVER-POWER THE IDEA/OPPORTUNITY/SUBJECT-MATTER DRIVEN APPROACH (ALDRICH AND KIM, 2007). EDUCATORS SHOULD CONSIDER IF THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO THESE LIMITATIONS AS THIS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE USE OF ACTIVE, OPPORTUNITY-DRIVEN TEAM FORMATION IN PRACTISE. TO COUNTER THE SECOND LIMITATION, EDUCATORS MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOW FAR INTO A COURSE THEY WANT TO FACILITATE THE TEAM FORMATION; ESPECIALLY FOR COURSES RUNNING OVER SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER PERIODS THAN TWO WEEKS. FUTURE RESEARCH MAY BE ABLE TO ASSESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE LIMITATIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW STUDENTS EXPERIENCE AND HANDLE A SHIFT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL TO A COLLABORATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IMPOSED ON THEM BY THE NOVEL AND UNIQUE DESIGN OF A COURSE THAT EXPLICITLY INCORPORATES THE TEAM FORMATION PROCESS INTO THE CURRICULUM. THIS IS UNDERTAKEN TO GAUGE THE EXTENT TO WHICH STUDENTS EXPERIENCE THIS SHIFT AS FITTING THE ACTUAL AND PERCEIVED NEED FOR SHARED PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING ENTERPRISING BEHAVIOUR, AND TO SHED LIGHT ON WHAT ACTION/PROCESS-BASED EED COURSES MAY BENEFIT FROM ACTIVELY INCLUDING A TEAM FORMATION PROCESS IN THE COURSE DESIGN. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: EED MAY BE OFFERED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. NEW ENTERPRISES ARE SEEN AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF ECONOMIC WEALTH AND FOR THE STUDENT, THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN NEW WAYS, BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS OR INTRAPRENEURS. ALSO, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOTH THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION AND THE STUDENT, IN THE FAST CHANGING WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE, THE DIGITAL MOBILITY AND MULTIPLICITY OF WORK ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRES A WORKFORCE THAT POSSESSES A RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL COMPETENCES. SUCH AS BEING PERSISTENT, ENGAGED AND HAVING GOOD IDEAS, COMPETENCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO TEACH AND HARD TO LEARN. ADDING TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO HANDLE THESE CONCERNS, THE PAPER POINTS AT A NUMBER OF SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF EED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THIS RESEARCH PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIELD OF EED BY EXEMPLIFYING HOW CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A COLLECTIVE ENTERPRISE, RATHER THAN AN INDIVIDUAL ONE, IMPACT STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FURTHERMORE, IT PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR EXPANDING RESEARCH AIMED AT PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH A LEARNING EXPERIENCE MORE IN LINE WITH THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR. 2017, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2017,FROM I TO WE: COLLABORATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AND LEARNING?,0

IT ALSO TRIES TO IDENTIFY THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DIL AND FIND CONSTRAINTS AFFECTING THE RELATED SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES OF THOSE PROFESSIONALS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY WAS ADOPTED IN THE FORM OF A SURVEY, WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN FROM FEBRUARY TO MARCH 2016. AS STATED BY KERLINGER (1986), THE SURVEY RESEARCH IS A USEFUL INSTRUMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL FACT-FINDING, AND A MEANS BY WHICH MUCH INFORMATION CAN BE ACQUIRED FROM THE STUDYS POPULATION. THE SURVEY INSTRUMENT WAS A SELF-ADMINISTRATED QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH WAS ADOPTED FOR DATA COLLECTION. A PILOT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS FIRST SENT TO A SMALL RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE RESPONDENTS, WITH FEEDBACK BEING USED TO FINE-TUNE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE. THE TARGETED POPULATION OF THIS STUDY INCLUDED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS (N = 127) BELONGING TO SVU LIBRARIES THAT SPREAD OVER THREE PROVINCES/CAMPUSES: THE QENA CAMPUS (NUMBER OF LIBRARIES = 22), THE LUXOR CAMPUS (N = 3) AND THE HURGHADA CAMPUS (N = 2). THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS ARE DESCRIBED TO BE LIBRARIANS, LIBRARY ASSISTANTS AND LIBRARY DIRECTORS. OF 127 QUESTIONNAIRES, 101 (79.5%) RESPONSES WERE RECEIVED. TO COLLECT DATA, THE STUDY USED A QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH HAS SIX SECTIONS REFLECTING THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT OVER TWO-THIRDS OF SVU LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS ARE MALES, AND ALMOST ONE-THIRD ARE FEMALES. MAJORITY RESPONDENTS ARE AGED BETWEEN 26 AND 40 YEARS, AND MOST POSSESSED BACHELORS DEGREES, OF WHICH NEARLY TWO-THIRDS HELD LIBRARY SCIENCE DEGREES. REGARDING THE RESPONDENTS PROFESSIONAL PROFILE, THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT MAJORITY WERE LIBRARIANS, FOLLOWED BY LIBRARY ASSISTANTS AND LIBRARY MANAGERS, AND NEARLY HALF HAD 10 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, FOLLOWED BY THOSE WHO HAVE WORK EXPERIENCE OF 6-7 YEARS. THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOME OF THE RESPONDENTS DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS (AGE AND EDUCATION) AND THEIR DIL. THE RESPONDENTS GENDER HAD NO EFFECT ON THEIR DIL. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL THE RESPONDENTS PROFESSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, PARTICULARLY THEIR DISCIPLINE, FOLLOWED BY JOB TITLE, WORK EXPERIENCE AND DIL. REGARDING THE LEVEL OF RESPONDENTS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TYPES OF COMPUTERS, MANY SHOWED THAT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF USING MOBILE DEVICES, FOLLOWED BY PCS, WORKSTATIONS, PORTABLE MEDIA PLAYERS/DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER AND PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANT WAS, AT THE LEAST, HIGH. THE RESPONDENTS KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER TYPES RANGED BETWEEN MODERATE TO NON-PROFICIENT. A LARGE NUMBER OF THE RESPONDENTS SHOWED THAT THEIR PROFICIENCY IN USING OUTPUT DEVICES, FOLLOWED BY INPUT DEVICES, PROCESSING DEVICES, STORAGE DEVICES AND COMMUNICATION DEVICES WAS ALSO, AT THE LEAST, HIGH. WHILE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF THE RESPONDENTS SHOWED THAT THEIR PROFICIENCY IN USING APPLICATION SOFTWARE WAS, AT LEAST, HIGH, THE LARGEST NUMBER OF THEM SHOWED THAT THEIR PROFICIENCY IN USING SYSTEM SOFTWARE WAS MODERATE. REGARDING THE RESPONDENTS KNOWLEDGE-BASED COMPETENCIES, AS WELL AS SKILLS-BASED COMPETENCIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE COMPETENCIES RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF ICTS INTO THE LIBRARY WORK, THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT SUCH KIND OF COMPETENCIES POSSESSED BY SVU LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS RANGED BETWEEN COMPETENT AND SOMEWHAT COMPETENT. REGARDING THE CHALLENGES AFFECTING THE RESPONDENTS ACQUIRING SKILLS AND RELATED COMPETENCIES, THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE LACK OF FUNDS, TRAINING, PHYSICAL FACILITIES, CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET, SUBSCRIBING TO E-DATABASES, LACK OF TIME AS WELL AS CHALLENGES RELATED TO SVU LIBRARY SYSTEM REGULATIONS, WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THEM. OTHER CHALLENGES SUCH AS THE LACK OF INCORPORATING AND EXPLOITING THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS INTO LIBRARY INTEGRATED SYSTEMS EDUCATORS SERVICES, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIERS, LACK OF CURRENT CURRICULA IN THE AREA OF ICTS AND A SHORTAGE OF EXPERIENCED LIS COUNSELORS, WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT TO THEM. THIS STUDY REACHED CONCLUSIONS THAT THE SVU LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS SHOULD BE QUALIFIED AND GET ADAPTED TO ICTS AND RELATED COMPETENCIES. THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT TRAINING TO UPDATE THEIR KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE USE AND INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR LIBRARY WORK. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES DIL AMONG LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS AT SVU, AN EGYPTIAN UNIVERSITY. ANY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS RESULTED FROM THIS STUDY ARE LIMITED IN SCOPE TO ONLY THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONALS OF THIS UNIVERSITY. SUCH A TOPIC HAS LIMITED PREVIOUS RESEARCH. THE SIZE AND HOMOGENEITY OF THE SAMPLE LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF THIS STUDY. PRACTICAL/IMPLICATIONS: THE STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE DIL ACQUIRED BY SVU LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS. THE POTENTIAL RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WOULD BE USEFUL FOR LIBRARY SCHOOLS, LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER PERTINENT AUTHORITIES FOR THE PLANNING OF TRAINING PROGRAMS AND COURSES. THE FINDINGS MAY ALSO BE HELPFUL FOR LIBRARY EDUCATORS TO DEVELOP CURRICULA THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY IS ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES CONDUCTED ON THIS TOPIC IN EGYPT. THE LITERATURE ON THE TOPIC OF THIS RESEARCH REVEALED THAT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON DIL IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT VERY LIMITED RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THIS TOPIC IN EGYPT AND SIMILAR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY AMONG ACADEMIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS. NO DEFINITION FOR THE CONCEPT OF DIL HAS YET BEEN PRODUCED, AND MANY EGYPTIAN ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS DEFINE THIS CONCEPT BASED ON THEIR OWN NEEDS DEPENDING ON EXISTING MODELS. 2017, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",2017,A SURVEY OF DIGITAL INFORMATION LITERACY (DIL) AMONG ACADEMIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS,0
