This site is for Jiewen's RMarkdown and Markdown docs. He has tried a ton of ways to save his docs (especially R codes), such as [HackMD](https://hackmd.io), [CoderBridge](https://zh-tw.coderbridge.com), even the popular academic website builder  [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com), but finally he came back to `blogdown`. Cuz he didn't need to convert file or do copy-paste job b/w diff platforms anymore. 

This blog is built through **Yihui's [hugo-prose theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-prose)**. The source code is licensed under MIT. The full source is available at https://github.com/yihui/hugo-prose. It's so easy and nice!
