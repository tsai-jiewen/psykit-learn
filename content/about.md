title: Jiewen and His Markdown Docs
---

This site is for Jiewen's RMarkdown and Markdown docs. He has tried a ton of ways to save his docs (especially R codes), such as [HackMD](https://hackmd.io), [CoderBridge](https://zh-tw.coderbridge.com), even the popular academic website builder  [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com), but finally he came back to `blogdown`. Cuz he didn't need to convert file or do copy-paste job b/w diff platforms anymore. It's so easy and nice!
